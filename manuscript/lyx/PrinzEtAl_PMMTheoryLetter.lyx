\begin_layout Abstract
The application of small-sized Markov state models (MSMs) has become a standard
 tool for the analysis of the dynamics in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
 and computation of key properties.
 As has been proven before, the predictive quality of the MSMs depends strongly
 on the selected discretization, which can results in unfeasible parametrization
s especially when low-dimensional experimental results are used.
 For the case of meta-stable dynamics we present a generalized theory to
 correctly describe the projection of markovian dynamics.
 This allows a much improved estimation of timescales and eigenvectors projected
 on the observable space.
 We demonstrate the presented approach on a numerical example.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In recent years Markov State Models (MSMs) have matured into a useful tool
 for the descriptions of dynamics that shows stochastic, but metastable
 behavior on the timescales of interest 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 This includes protein dynamics, chemical [cite], physical systems [cite],
 etc.
 Its application spans dynamics that can be written using a differential
 equation that is first order in time and has also been applied for various
 types of dynamics, e.g.
 Brownian dynamics, Langevin dynamics, etc...
 Once a MSM has been succesfully parametrized from data it allows to quickly
 compute a large variety of target properties like relaxation timescales,
 mean first passage times, metastable subsets 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Roblitz:2013cg,DeuflhardWeber_PCCA"

\end_inset

 and path related properties like reactive pathways and committor probabilities
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VandenEijnden:2006ki,Metzner:2009ub"

\end_inset

.
 The usage of conditional jump probabilities also allows to effectively
 split the generation of necessary statistics into independent subproblems
 that require only local equilibrium and can be thus be parallelized as
 used in adaptive sampling techniques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A MSM requires a crisp or fuzzy decomposition of the available state space
 into finite set of states between which the system can jump.
 If done carefully this can reduce the dominant dynamics to a very small
 system of transition probabilities.
 However, the prediction quality crucially depends on the choice of this
 subsets 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Djurdjevac:MYsgGZyA,Sarich:2010wa"

\end_inset

 and the task of finding an optimal decomposition requires full knowledge
 of the dominant eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the associated propagator.
 Often this propagator is approximated by a fine discretization that can
 then be clustered using a metastability anaylsis 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Roblitz:2013cg,DeuflhardWeber_PCCA"

\end_inset

 from the data in a finite timeseries.
 Even if we have perfect statistics, an optimal decomposition requires access
 to the dynamics in the full state space which is only available in atomistic
 simulations and even then usually a dimension reduction is unavoidable
 to keep the system size tractable.
 In most feasible cases

\end_inset

 especially dynamics observed from experiments 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

 the available timeseries might be deteriorated by stochastic noise and
 more important a projection onto the observable subspace.
 In these cases the MSM approach fails since dominant eigenvectors cannot
 be approximated with sufficient accuracy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Single-molecule experiments, e.g FRET, AFM and Optical Tweezer [cite examples],
 provide access to exactly these kind of projected dynamics that can already
 span much larger timescales than accessible with simulations.
 To make use of these data a generalization of MSMs for these projected
 Markovian dynamics is necessary.
 In this paper we present a novel approach to treat these projected dynamics
 in the case of metastability correct and overcome some of the previously
 described deficiencies of MSMs, leading to a deeper understanding of the
 projection error.

\begin_layout Section
Theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x_{t}\mid x_{t}\in\Omega,t\in\mathbb{R}^{+}\}$
\end_inset

 be the (stochastic) process of interest in full state space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 which we require to be Markovian, time-homogeneous, ergodic and reversible
 wrt.
 its unique stationary distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

.
 For a time-homogeneous Markov process the time evolution of the probability
 density 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}(x)\equiv\mathbb{P}(x_{t}=x)$
\end_inset

 can be expressed using a time-step 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 (also called lag time) dependent propagator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{t}(x) & = & \mathcal{P}_{\tau}\left[p_{t}\right](x)\\
 & \equiv & \int_{\Omega}\text{d}x'\,\mathbb{P}\left[x_{t+\tau}=x\mid x_{t}=x'\right]p_{t}(x').
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Ergodicity and reversibility of 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x_{t}\}$
\end_inset

 then implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 is compact and self-adjoint wrt.
 the stationary density 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 on a Hilbert space defined by the inner product
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\langle u,v\rangle\equiv\int_{\Omega}\text{d}x\, u(x)v(x)\mu^{-1}(x)
\]

\end_inset

and we can expand the propagator into a countable sum 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{P}_{\tau}p_{t}=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\lambda_{i}(\tau)\phi_{i}\langle\phi_{i},p_{t}\rangle
\]

\end_inset

of orthogonal eigenfunction/eigenvalue pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $\{(\lambda_{i}(\tau),\phi_{i})\mid i\in\mathbb{N}\}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\langle\phi_{i},\phi_{i}\rangle=\delta_{ij}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Vert\lambda_{i}\Vert\leq1$
\end_inset

.
 For convenience we order all pairs with descending magnitude of the eigenvalue
 where the uniqueness of the stationary distribution ensures that the eigenvalue
 of one 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

 is single and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1}=\mu$
\end_inset

.
 The semi-group property of a markov chain also implies a relation 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}(k\tau)=\lambda_{i}^{k}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 s.t.
 we can define 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}^{\tau}\equiv\lambda_{i}^{\tau}(1)$
\end_inset

 as the eigenvalues at the native lag time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To describe metastability which we required we use that metastability leads
 to gaps in the spectrum of the propagator 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bovier:2005a"

\end_inset

 where the finite set of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 eigenvalue/eigenfunction pairs above the gap (being slower) describe the
 metastable dynamics while the remaining faster pairs describe the fast
 dynamics within metastable sets.
 That these separation is possible and the dynamics do not mix follows from
 the orthogonality of the eigenfunctions.
 Thus we can split the propagator
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{P}_{\tau} & = & \mathcal{P}_{\tau}^{\text{meta}}+\mathcal{P}_{\tau}^{\text{fast}}\nonumber \\
 &  & \sum_{k=1}^{m}\lambda_{i}(\tau)\phi_{i}\langle\phi_{i},\,\cdot\,\rangle+\mathcal{P}_{\tau}^{\text{fast}}\label{eq:metastable-dynamics}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Vert\mathcal{P}_{\tau}^{\text{fast}}\Vert\in\mathcal{O}\left(\lambda_{m+1}^{\tau}\right)$
\end_inset

 and conclusively, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\gg-1/\log\lambda_{m+1}$
\end_inset

 the fast part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 has decayed and the dynamics can be well approximated by the metastable
 part 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{\tau}\approx\mathcal{P}_{\tau}^{\text{meta}}$
\end_inset

.
 In this paper we will be dealing with this type of dynamics and call this
 an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Usually, the full dynamics is not directly observable, either by an artificially
 induced discretization, the experimental setup or unavoidable sideeffects
 like noise.
 Instead we have to deal with a projected process 
\begin_inset Formula $\{y_{t}\mid y_{t}\in\Upsilon,t\in\mathbb{R}^{+}\}$
\end_inset

 on an observable space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Upsilon=\{1,\ldots,K\}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 states which we choose to be finite.
 To describe the probabilistic relation between 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 we use a output probability functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{i}$
\end_inset

 so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\chi_{k}(x)\equiv\mathbb{P}\left(y_{t}=k\mid x_{t}=x\right)
\]

\end_inset

which explicitely assumes that the output probabilities are time independent
 and also contain no memory s.t.
 each state 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\Omega$
\end_inset

 in the full state space always maps into 
\begin_inset Formula $\Upsilon$
\end_inset

 in the same way.
 The combination of the reversible Markov state model and output probabilities
 will be called a 
\emph on
projected Markov model 
\emph default
(PMM), if in addition the full state dynamics is 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-metastable we will refer to 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-metastable PMM or short 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-PMM.
 Note, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\{y_{t}\}$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 a Markov chain anymore unless the output probability functions exactly
 span the space of the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 dominant eigenfunctions, which is either impossible due to experimental
 constraints or requires explicit knowledge of the propagator.
 Therefore the popular modelling using a Markov state model (MSM) is often
 only approximate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To capture the dynamics of a PMM we compute the state-to-state correlation
 matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{ij}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 in the observable space 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
C_{ij}(\tau) & \equiv & \mathbb{P}\left[y_{t+\tau}=j\,\wedge\, y_{t}=i\right]\\
 & = & \iint_{\Omega^{2}}\text{d}x\,\text{d}x'\,\chi_{i}(x)\mathbb{P}\left[x_{t+\tau}=x\,\wedge\, x_{t}=x'\right]\chi_{j}(x')
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

for the stochstic process 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 which implicitely assumes infinite statistics.
 In this case the expression can be rewritten as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
C_{ij}(\tau) & = & \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\lambda_{i}(\tau)\int_{\Omega}\text{d}x\,\chi_{i}(x)\phi_{k}(x)\int_{\Omega}\text{d}x'\,\phi_{k}(x')\chi_{j}(x')\\
 & = & \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\lambda_{i}(\tau)Q_{ki}\, Q_{kj}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

with the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 of 
\emph on
projected eigenfunctions 
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q_{ki}\equiv\int_{\Omega}\text{d}x\,\chi_{i}(x)\phi_{k}(x).
\]

\end_inset

Using the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda\equiv\text{diag}\left(\lambda_{1},\ldots\right)$
\end_inset

 we can finally write
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C(\tau)=Q^{\text{T}}\Lambda(\tau)Q
\]

\end_inset

which is exact for any PMM but might require countable, but infinite sized
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

.
 For a 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-PMM the metastability reduces this size to 
\begin_inset Formula $Q\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times K}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$
\end_inset

 which is much more tractable.
 We conclude that all correlation functions on the observable space of a
 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-PMM can exactly be represented by the parametrization into 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Section
Spectral Estimation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal will be to construct a learning algorithm to estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 from a given observation 
\begin_inset Formula $\{y_{t}\}$
\end_inset

.
 This will allow us to correctly estimate all dominant eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the full propagator.
 As input for the learning algorithm we use the state-to-state correlation
 matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $C(\tau)$
\end_inset

, which can easily be estimated from a finite timeseries.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $C(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is by construction symmetric 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The real 
\begin_inset Formula $C(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is symmetric for reversible dynamics, while an estimated 
\begin_inset Formula $C(\tau)$
\end_inset

 might not, depending on the estimation procedure.
 Also if the the used data is finite and is not sampled from global equilibrium
 the estimated 
\begin_inset Formula $C(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is not symmetric!
\end_layout

\end_inset

, the number of independent variables in a single 
\begin_inset Formula $C(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is smaller than the variables to be parametrized in 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda(\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 Conclusively, a single 
\begin_inset Formula $C(\tau)$
\end_inset

 does not contain enough information to allow for a unique decomposition
 of a given 
\begin_inset Formula $C(\tau)$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

.
 In MSMs this lack of information is filled by an orthogonality constraint
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q^{T}Q=\text{diag}(\pi)
\]

\end_inset

wrt.
 the observed stationary distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 Other decompositions of this type include the singular value decomposition
 for symmetric matrices (SVD) or, equivalently, the eigenvalue decomposition
 (EVD) which both assume orthogonality 
\begin_inset Formula $Q^{T}Q=\text{Id}$
\end_inset

 or the Cholesky decomposition that instead uses a triangular shaped 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
 It can be shown (see SI), that two correlation matrices at two different
 lagtimes 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{2}$
\end_inset

 provide enough information to solve this problem uniquely in the case of
 an 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-PMM and positive eigenvalues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will first address the special case where the number of dominant eigenvalues
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 equals the number of observable states 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is square.
 This case can always be achieved by an additional projection onto 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 states provided that initially the number of observed states is larger
 than the number of processes 
\begin_inset Formula $K>m$
\end_inset

.
 The problem then reduces to solving the generalized hermitian eigenvalue
 problem (GHEP)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C(\tau_{1})u_{i}=\nu_{i}C(\tau_{2})u_{i}
\]

\end_inset

for the generalized eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and eigenvectors 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

 that are related to the dominant eigenvalues by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda_{i}=\nu_{i}^{1/(\tau_{1}-\tau_{2})}
\]

\end_inset

to compute the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 of projected eigenvectors by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q=U^{-1}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $U=[u_{1},\ldots,u_{m}]$
\end_inset

 is the matrix of the generalized eigenvectors 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

 that are normalized so that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Vert u_{i}\Vert^{2}=\lambda_{i}^{\tau_{1}}\left(u_{i}^{T}C(\tau_{1})u_{i}\right)^{-1}
\]

\end_inset

holds.
 Note, that a GHEP can also be solved using an inversion of one matrix,
 but this is not necessary.
 Also this transforms the problem into a non-symmetric problem and the inversion
 might be badly conditioned.
 Nonetheless, we can compute the solutions using an ordinary EVD of 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{-1}(\tau_{2})C(\tau_{2})$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Section
Low-rank approximation

\begin_layout Standard
In most cases we are only interested in the dominant processes that govern
 the dynamics as stated in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:metastable-dynamics"

\end_inset

.
 Since the spectral estimation method is (almost) independent of the projection
 we can project onto a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 states, then apply the spectral estimation method and retrieve the dominant
 timescales.
 If we also want to reconstruct the dominant processes on the complete observabl
e space we need to use a generating set of vectors for the space spanned
 by the projected left eigenvectors.
 Since we have no direct access to the eigenvectors we can use the singular
 value decomposition 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
C(\tau)\rightarrow V(\tau)\Sigma(\tau)V^{T}(\tau)\label{eq:svd-decomposition}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which for a symmetric matrix provides for a decomposition into a matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and a diagonal matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

.
 If for a particular 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau>\tau_{\text{min}}$
\end_inset

 only 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 singular values exist then 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 must span the same subspace of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Upsilon$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 which follows from rank considerations.
 As stated before, the decomposition in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 is not unique and the SVD requires 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{T}V=\text{Id}$
\end_inset

 which is not the correct solution.
 The most general form the correct solution can take is 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=AV$

 being an 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times m$
\end_inset

 matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $C(\tau_{2})$
\end_inset

 makes the decomposition unique.

 The process 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}\in\Omega$

 in the full state space is also projected onto the second (
\begin_inset Formula $y$

) coordinate which is then clustered onto 28 equidistant bins (
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x=0.05$
\end_inset

) as 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{t}\in\Omega\mapsto x_{t}^{(2)}\mapsto y_{t}\in\Upsilon=\{1,\ldots,28\}
\]

\end_inset

where the bins comprise the observable space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Upsilon=\{1,\ldots,28\}$
\end_inset

.
 For the computation of reference values we also discretized the system
 into a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $28\times28$
\end_inset

 equidistant bins while the SE and MSM is applied to the observed space
 only.
 Two cases of data are considered (I) infinite statistics 
\begin_inset Formula $L\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 and (II) a timeseries of length 
\begin_inset Formula $L=10^{6}$
\end_inset

 which is long compared to the slowest relaxation timescale of 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{2}=382.4$
\end_inset

 and can thus be considered a case of converged and good, but finite statistics.

 A piezoactuator controlled the position of the trap and allowed position
 resolution to within 0.5 nm, with the instrument operated in passive (equilibriu

 data collection.
 The force on the bead held in the optical trap was recorded at 50 kHz,

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We presented a novel approach to estimate the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 of a projected Markov state model (PMM).
 The method has been demonstated at a simple illustrative model and shows
 much improved convergence in the estimation of the dominant timescales
 as well as related projected eigenvectors.
 Although the sensitivity to statistical noise has increased the method
 still provides better results compared to the MSM approach.
 The sensitivity can be reduced if the estimation is reformulated into an
 optimization problem that fits the result at more than two lagtimes.
 We have applied the optimizational approach to data from Apo-Myoglobin
 and showed a consistent set of two processes (maybe four).
 On first sight the estimation for 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-PMMs looks identical to and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-state HMM, but it can be shown that HMMs are not able to capture all possible
 dynamics of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-PMMs and HMMs can model a subset of the dynamics of PMMs.
 Thus the HMM solution might be close, but rarely exact
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Finally, the cases of low-statistics and non-reversible dynamics is interesting
 and subject of active research.
