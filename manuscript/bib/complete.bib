abstract = {The microscopic interactions and mechanisms leading to nascent protein folding events are generally unknown. While such short time-scale events are difficult to study experimentally, molecular dynamics simulations of peptides can provide a useful model for studying events related to protein folding initiation. Recently, two extremely long molecular dynamics simulations (2.2 ns each) were carried out on the pentapeptide Tyr-Pro-Gly-Asp-Val [Tobias, D. J., Mertz, J. E., {\&} Brooks, C. L., III (1991) Biochemistry 30, 6054-6058] that forms stable reverse turns in solution. Tobias et al. examined folding events in this large system (approximately 30,000 conformations) using traditional methods of trajectory analysis. The shear magnitude of this problem prompted us to develop an automated approach, based on self-organizing neural nets, to extract the key features of the molecular dynamics trajectory. The neural net is used to perform conformational clustering, which reduces the complexity of a system while minimizing the loss of information. The conformations were grouped together using distances in dihedral angle space as a measure of conformational similarity. The resulting clusters represent "conformational states", and transitions between these states were examined to identify mechanisms of conformational change. Many conformational changes involved the rotation of only a single dihedral angle, but concerted angle changes were also found. Most of the conformational information in the 30,000 samples from the full trajectories was retained in the relatively few resultant clusters, providing a powerful tool for analysis of an expanding base of large molecular simulations.},

abstract = {It has long been known that a protein's amino acid sequence dictates its native structure. However, despite significant recent advances, an ensemble description of how a protein achieves its native conformation from random coil under physiologically relevant conditions remains incomplete. Here we present a detailed all-atom model with a transferable potential that is capable of ab initio folding of entire protein domains using only sequence information. The computational efficiency of this model allows us to perform thousands of microsecond-time scale-folding simulations of the engrailed homeodomain and to observe thousands of complete independent folding events. We apply a graph-theoretic analysis to this massive data set to elucidate which intermediates and intermediary states are common to many trajectories and thus important for the folding process. This method provides an atomically detailed and complete picture of a folding pathway at the ensemble level. The approach that we describe is quite general and could be used to study the folding of proteins on time scales orders of magnitude longer than currently possible.},

abstract = {An efficient method is proposed for building Markov models with discrete states able to accurately describe the slow relaxation of a complex system with two stable conformations. First, the reaction pathway described by a set of collective variables between the two stable states is determined using the string method with swarms of trajectories. Then, short trajectories are initiated at different points along this pathway to build the state-to-state transition probability matrix. It is shown, using a model system, how this strategy makes it possible to use trajectories that are significantly shorter than the slowest relaxation time to efficiently build a reliable and accurate Markov model. Extensions of the method to multiple pathways, as well as some common pitfalls arising from poorly relaxed paths or an inappropriate choice of collective variables, are illustrated and discussed.},

abstract = {Discrete-state Markov (or master equation) models provide a useful simplified representation for characterizing the long-time statistical evolution of biomolecules in a manner that allows direct comparison with experiments as well as the elucidation of mechanistic pathways for an inherently stochastic process. A vital part of meaningful comparison with experiment is the characterization of the statistical uncertainty in the predicted experimental measurement, which may take the form of an equilibrium measurement of some spectroscopic signal, the time-evolution of this signal following a perturbation, or the observation of some statistic (such as the correlation function) of the equilibrium dynamics of a single molecule. Without meaningful error bars (which arise from both approximation and statistical error), there is no way to determine whether the deviations between model and experiment are statistically meaningful. Previous work has demonstrated that a Bayesian method that enforces microscopic reversibility can be used to characterize the statistical component of correlated uncertainties in state-to-state transition probabilities (and functions thereof) for a model inferred from molecular simulation data. Here, we extend this approach to include the uncertainty in observables that are functions of molecular conformation (such as surrogate spectroscopic signals) characterizing each state, permitting the full statistical uncertainty in computed spectroscopic experiments to be assessed. We test the approach in a simple model system to demonstrate that the computed uncertainties provide a useful indicator of statistical variation, and then apply it to the computation of the fluorescence autocorrelation function measured for a dye-labeled peptide previously studied by both experiment and simulation.},

abstract = {To date, the slowest-folding proteins folded ab initio by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have had folding times in the range of nanoseconds to microseconds. We report simulations of several folding trajectories of NTL9(1-39), a protein which has a folding time of approximately 1.5 ms. Distributed molecular dynamics simulations in implicit solvent on GPU processors were used to generate ensembles of trajectories out to approximately 40 micros for several temperatures and starting states. At a temperature less than the melting point of the force field, we observe a small number of productive folding events, consistent with predictions from a model of parallel uncoupled two-state simulations. The posterior distribution of the folding rate predicted from the data agrees well with the experimental folding rate (approximately 640/s). Markov State Models (MSMs) built from the data show a gap in the implied time scales indicative of two-state folding and heterogeneous pathways connecting diffuse mesoscopic substates. Structural analysis of the 14 out of 2000 macrostates transited by the top 10 folding pathways reveals that native-like pairing between strands 1 and 2 only occurs for macrostates with p(fold) > 0.5, suggesting beta(12) hairpin formation may be rate-limiting. We believe that using simulation data such as these to seed adaptive resampling simulations will be a promising new method for achieving statistically converged descriptions of folding landscapes at longer time scales than ever before.},

abstract = {Discrete-space Markov models are a convenient way of describing the kinetics of biomolecules. The most common strategies used to validate these models employ statistics from simulation data, such as the eigenvalue spectrum of the inferred rate matrix, which are often associated with large uncertainties. Here, we propose a Bayesian approach, which makes it possible to differentiate between models at a fixed lag time making use of short trajectories. The hierarchical definition of the models allows one to compare instances with any number of states. We apply a conjugate prior for reversible Markov chains, which was recently introduced in the statistics literature. The method is tested in two different systems, a Monte Carlo dynamics simulation of a two-dimensional model system and molecular dynamics simulations of the terminally blocked alanine dipeptide.},

abstract = {In many fields of physics, chemistry, and biology, the characterization of rates and pathways between certain states or species is of fundamental interest. The central mathematical object in such situations is the committor probability---a generalized reaction coordinate that measures the progress of the process as the probability of proceeding to the target state rather than relapsing to the source state. Here, we conduct a numerical analysis of the committor. First, it is shown that committors can be expressed by the stationary eigenfunctions of a modified dynamical operator, thus relating the committors to the dominant eigenfunctions of the original operator. Based on this reformulation, committors can be efficiently computed for systems with large state spaces. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis of the committor is conducted, which allows its statistical uncertainty from estimation to be quantified within a Bayesian framework. The methods are illustrated on two examples of diffusive dynamics: a two-dimensional model potential with three minima, and a three-dimensional model representing protein-ligand binding.},

We show that identification is possible based on the observation sequences of some essential torsion or backbone angles. In particular, the method still provides good results even if the conformations do have a strong overlap in these angles. To apply HMMs to angular data, we use von Mises output distributions. The performance of the resulting method is illustrated by numerical tests and by application to a hybrid Monte Carlo time series of trialanine and to MD simulation results of a DNA-oligomer.},

abstract = {Previous work has indicated that in calculating rates using activated-complex theory one should omit symmetry numbers from the rotational partition functions and multiply by a statistical factor; this factor is the number of equivalent forms of the activated complex that can arise from the reactants. This procedure can lead to error if the activated complex is chosen to have such a high degree of symmetry that it can form more than one form of the reactants or products. It is shown from a consideration of multi-dimensional potential-energy surfaces that a single activated complex cannot exist at the intersection of two valleys; three valleys, for example, will give rise to three separate activated states, each of which represents the lowest pass between a pair of valleys. The implications of this conclusion are considered with reference to several reactions, including that between hydrogen and iodine.

abstract = {The power stroke pulling myosin along actin filaments during muscle contraction is achieved by a large rotation ( approximately 60 degrees ) of the myosin lever arm after ATP hydrolysis. Upon binding the next ATP, myosin dissociates from actin, but its ATPase site is still partially open and catalytically off. Myosin must then close and activate its ATPase site while returning the lever arm for the next power stroke. A mechanism for this coupling between the ATPase site and the distant lever arm is determined here by generating a continuous series of optimized intermediates between the crystallographic end-states of the recovery stroke. This yields a detailed structural model for communication between the catalytic and the force-generating regions that is consistent with experimental observations. The coupling is achieved by an amplifying cascade of conformational changes along the relay helix lying between the ATPase and the domain carrying the lever arm.},

abstract = {Protein folding barriers result from a combination of factors including unavoidable energetic frustration from nonnative interactions, natural variation and selection of the amino acid sequence for function, and/or selection pressure against aggregation. The rate-limiting step for human Pin1 WW domain folding is the formation of the loop 1 substructure. The native conformation of this six-residue loop positions side chains that are important for mediating protein-protein interactions through the binding of Pro-rich sequences. Replacement of the wild-type loop 1 primary structure by shorter sequences with a high propensity to fold into a type-I' beta-turn conformation or the statistically preferred type-I G1 bulge conformation accelerates WW domain folding by almost an order of magnitude and increases thermodynamic stability. However, loop engineering to optimize folding energetics has a significant downside: it effectively eliminates WW domain function according to ligand-binding studies. The energetic contribution of loop 1 to ligand binding appears to have evolved at the expense of fast folding and additional protein stability. Thus, the two-state barrier exhibited by the wild-type human Pin1 WW domain principally results from functional requirements, rather than from physical constraints inherent to even the most efficient loop formation process.},

abstract = {An understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding requires a knowledge of the free energy surface governing the motion of the polypeptide chain. Because of the many degrees of freedom involved, surfaces projected on only one or two progress variables are generally used in descriptions of the folding reaction. Such projections result in relatively smooth surfaces, but they could mask the complexity of the unprojected surface. Here we introduce an approach to determine the actual (unprojected) free energy surface and apply it to the second beta-hairpin of protein G, which has been used as a model system for protein folding. The surface is represented by a disconnectivity graph calculated from a long equilibrium folding-unfolding trajectory. The denatured state is found to have multiple low free energy basins. Nevertheless, the peptide shows exponential kinetics in folding to the native basin. Projected surfaces obtained from the present analysis have a simple form in agreement with other studies of the beta-hairpin. The hidden complexity found for the beta-hairpin surface suggests that the standard funnel picture of protein folding should be revisited.},

abstract = {The dynamical behavior of many systems arising in physics, chemistry, biology, etc. is dominated by rare but important transition events between long lived states. For over 70 years, transition state theory (TST) has provided the main theoretical framework for the description of these events [17,33,34]. Yet, while TST and evolutions thereof based on the reactive flux formalism [1, 5] (see also [30,31]) give an accurate estimate of the transition rate of a reaction, at least in principle, the theory tells very little in terms of the mechanism of this reaction. Recent advances, such as transition path sampling (TPS) of Bolhuis, Chandler, Dellago, and Geissler [3, 7] or the action method of Elber [15, 16], may seem to go beyond TST in that respect: these techniques allow indeed to sample the ensemble of reactive trajectories, i.e. the trajectories by which the reaction occurs. And yet, the reactive trajectories may again be rather uninformative about the mechanism of the reaction. This may sound paradoxical at first: what more than actual reactive trajectories could one need to understand a reaction? The problem, however, is that the reactive trajectories by themselves give only a very indirect information about the statistical properties of these trajectories. This is similar to why statistical mechanics is not simply a footnote in books about classical mechanics. What is the probability density that a trajectory be at a given location in state-space conditional on it being reactive? What is the probability current of these reactive trajectories? What is their rate of appearance? These are the questions of interest and they are not easy to answer directly from the ensemble of reactive trajectories. The right framework to tackle these questions also goes beyond standard equilibrium statistical mechanics because of the nontrivial bias that the very definition of the reactive trajectories imply -- they must be involved in a reaction. The aim of this chapter is to introduce the reader to the probabilistic framework one can use to characterize the mechanism of a reaction and obtain the probability density, current, rate, etc. of the reactive trajectories.},

Recent advances include clarification of the fundamental issues concerning the separation of entropy into components, the treatment of association entropy in binding, and the role of size and shape effects in solvation entropy. Advances in the application of entropy calculations include an emerging consensus for estimates of backbone and sidechain entropy loss in protein folding via use of numerically intensive methods for sampling, and use of the expanding protein-structure database.},

abstract = {The slow processes of metastable stochastic dynamical systems are difficult to access by direct numerical simulation due the sampling problem. Here, we suggest an approach for modeling the slow parts of Markov processes by approximating the dominant eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the propagator. To this end, a variational principle is derived that is based on the maximization of a Raleigh coefficient. It is shown that this Raleigh coefficient can be estimated from statistical observables that can be obtained from short distributed simulations starting from different parts of state space. The approach forms a basis for the development of adaptive and efficient computational algorithms for simulating and analyzing metastable Markov processes while avoiding the sampling problem. Since any stochastic process with finite memory can be transformed into a Markov process, the approach is applicable to a wide range of processes relevant for modeling complex real-world phenomena.},

abstract = {The problem of spontaneous folding of amino acid chains into highly organized, biologically functional three-dimensional protein structures continues to challenge the modern science. Understanding how proteins fold requires characterization of the underlying energy landscapes as well as the dynamics of the polypeptide chains in all stages of the folding process. In recent years, important advances toward these goals have been achieved owing to the rapidly growing interdisciplinary interest and significant progress in both experimental techniques and theoretical methods. Improvements in the experimental time resolution led to determination of the timescales of the important elementary events in folding, such as formation of secondary structure and tertiary contacts. Sensitive single molecule methods made possible probing the distributions of the unfolded and folded states and following the folding reaction of individual protein molecules. Discovery of proteins that fold in microseconds opened the possibility of atomic-level theoretical simulations of folding and their direct comparisons with experimental data, as well as of direct experimental observation of the barrier-less folding transition. The ultra-fast folding also brought new questions, concerning the intrinsic limits of the folding rates and experimental signatures of barrier-less "downhill" folding. These problems will require novel approaches for even more detailed experimental investigations of the folding dynamics as well as for the analysis of the folding kinetic data. For theoretical simulations of folding, a main challenge is how to extract the relevant information from overwhelmingly detailed atomistic trajectories. New theoretical methods have been devised to allow a systematic approach towards a quantitative analysis of the kinetic network of folding-unfolding transitions between various configuration states of a protein, revealing the transition states and the associated folding pathways at multiple levels, from atomistic to coarse-grained representations. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Protein Dynamics: Experimental and Computational Approaches.},

abstract = {This article describes the software suite GROMACS (Groningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) that was developed at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, in the early 1990s. The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.

We first validate the theory by showing that, for the RNA molecules we tested having only secondary structures, this treatment (i) predicts about the same native structures as the Zuker method, and (ii) qualitatively predicts the melting curve peaks and shoulders seen in experiments. We then predict thermodynamic folding intermediates. For one hairpin sequence, unfolding is a simple unzipping process. But for another sequence, unfolding is more complex. It involves multiple stable intermediates and a rezipping into a completely non-native conformation before unfolding. The principle that emerges, for which there is growing experimental support, is that although protein folding tends to involve highly cooperative two-state thermodynamic transitions, without detectable intermediates, the folding of RNA secondary structures may involve rugged landscapes, often with more complex intermediate states.},

The thermodynamic functions can be evaluated from the ratio of the effective partition functions of the residues in the different conformants, the difference in their zeros of energy, and the temperature derivatives of these partition functions. The former two parameters were evaluated from published optical density data of the conformants within the transition region; the last item was obtained from published heat-capacity data of the pure conformants outside the transition region.

The theory is formulated in terms of subunit partition functions, which are the average partition functions of the residues modulated by their interactions with each other and the solvent. The theory is specialized to a system of two types of conformants: type A (for example, protein in the folded state) consisting of subunits of type ``a'', and type B (for example, protein in the unfolded state) consisting of subunits of type ``b'', assuming complete cooperativity. It is shown that for such a model, the heat capacity and enthalpy functions obtained from the isothermal−isobaric partition function of the biomolecular system can be calculated from the ratio of the partition functions of the ``a'' and ``b'' subunits, their temperature derivatives, and the difference between the lowest enthalpy levels of the subunits.

abstract = {Mathematical modeling of skin transport is considered a valuable alternative of in-vitro and in-vivo investigations especially considering ethical and economical questions. Mechanistic diffusion models describe skin transport by solving Fick's 2nd law of diffusion in time and space; however models relying entirely on a consistent experimental data set are missing. For a two-dimensional model membrane consisting of a biphasic stratum corneum (SC) and a homogeneous epidermal/dermal compartment (DSL) methods are presented to determine all relevant input parameters. The data were generated for flufenamic acid (M(W) 281.24g/mol; logK(Oct/H2O) 4.8; pK(a) 3.9) and caffeine (M(W) 194.2g/mol; logK(Oct/H2O) -0.083; pK(a) 1.39) using female abdominal skin. K(lip/don) (lipid-donor partition coefficient) was determined in equilibration experiments with human SC lipids. K(cor/lip) (corneocyte-lipid) and K(DSL/lip) (DSL-lipid) were derived from easily available experimental data, i.e. K(SC/don) (SC-donor), K(lip/don) and K(SC/DSL) (SC-DSL) considering realistic volume fractions of the lipid and corneocyte phases. Lipid and DSL diffusion coefficients D(lip) and D(DSL) were calculated based on steady state flux. The corneocyte diffusion coefficient D(cor) is not accessible experimentally and needs to be estimated by simulation. Based on these results time-dependent stratum corneum concentration-depth profiles were simulated and compared to experimental profiles in an accompanying study.},

abstract = {The growing adoption of generalized-ensemble algorithms for biomolecular simulation has resulted in a resurgence in the use of the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) to make use of all data generated by these simulations. Unfortunately, the original presentation of WHAM by Kumar et al. is not directly applicable to data generated by these methods. WHAM was originally formulated to combine data from independent samplings of the canonical ensemble, whereas many generalized-ensemble algorithms sample from mixtures of canonical ensembles at different temperatures. Sorting configurations generated from a parallel tempering simulation by temperature obscures the temporal correlation in the data and results in an improper treatment of the statistical uncertainties used in constructing the estimate of the density of states. Here we present variants of WHAM, STWHAM and PTWHAM, derived with the same set of assumptions, that can be directly applied to several generalized ensemble algorithms, including simulated tempering, parallel tempering (better known as replica-exchange among temperatures), and replica-exchange simulated tempering. We present methods that explicitly capture the considerable temporal correlation in sequentially generated configurations using autocorrelation analysis. This allows estimation of the statistical uncertainty in WHAM estimates of expectations for the canonical ensemble. We test the method with a one-dimensional model system and then apply it to the estimation of potentials of mean force from parallel tempering simulations of the alanine dipeptide in both implicit and explicit solvent.},

abstract = {We construct coarse master equations for peptide folding dynamics from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. A maximum-likelihood propagator-based method allows us to extract accurate rates for the transitions between the different conformational states of the small helix-forming peptide Ala5. Assigning the conformational states by using transition paths instead of instantaneous molecular coordinates suppresses the effects of fast non-Markovian dynamics. The resulting master equations are validated by comparing their analytical correlation functions with those obtained directly from the molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the master equations properly capture the character and relaxation times of the entire spectrum of conformational relaxation processes. By using the eigenvectors of the transition rate matrix, we are able to systematically coarse-grain the system. We find that a two-state description, with a folded and an unfolded state, roughly captures the slow conformational dynamics. A four-state model, with two folded and two unfolded states, accurately recovers the three slowest relaxation process with time scales between 1.5 and 7 ns. The master equation models not only give access to the slow conformational dynamics but also shed light on the molecular mechanisms of the helix-coil transition.},

The formulation presented is unique in that the velocities are based on a direct second order Taylor expansion of the inertial forces. The resulting finite difference equation is compared with a previous formulation of Verlet-based Langevin dynamics. The equations are implemented to study the physical properties of dense neon and liquid water at constant temperatures as a function of the friction rate gamma. The results show canonical ensembles can be obtained at moderate friction rates without recurring to switching functions to control energy losses, or overdamping. The LD methodology is further applied to a protein in solution and compared to MD simulations which use a more conventional scaling function for temperature control. Analyses of the MD trajectories show the protein remains at either lower or higher temperature compared to the solvent, depending upon the treatment of the potential function at the system's boundary. On the contrary, LD simulations show a rapid and even equilibration between protein and solvent in all cases. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The histogram test, based on estimated committor probabilities, is often used as a qualitative indicator for good reaction coordinates. This paper derives the mean and variance of the intrinsic committor distribution in terms of the mean and variance of the histogram of committor estimates. These convenient formulas enable the first quantitative calculations of reaction coordinate error for complex systems. An example shows that the approximate transition state surface from Peters' and Trout's reaction coordinate for nucleation in the Ising model gives a mean committor probability of 0.495 and a standard deviation of 0.042.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be used to estimate transition rates between conformational substates of the simulated molecule. Such an estimation is associated with statistical uncertainty, which depends on the number of observed transitions. In turn, it induces uncertainties in any property computed from the simulation, such as free energy differences or the time scales involved in the system's kinetics. Assessing these uncertainties is essential for testing the reliability of a given observation and also to plan further simulations in such a way that the most serious uncertainties will be reduced with minimal effort. Here, a rigorous statistical method is proposed to approximate the complete statistical distribution of any observable of an MD simulation provided that one can identify conformational substates such that the transition process between them may be modeled with a memoryless jump process, i.e., Markov or Master equation dynamics. The method is based on sampling the statistical distribution of Markov transition matrices that is induced by the observed transition events. It allows physically meaningful constraints to be included, such as sampling only matrices that fulfill detailed balance, or matrices that produce a predefined equilibrium distribution of states. The method is illustrated on mus MD simulations of a hexapeptide for which the distributions and uncertainties of the free energy differences between conformations, the transition matrix elements, and the transition matrix eigenvalues are estimated. It is found that both constraints, detailed balance and predefined equilibrium distribution, can significantly reduce the uncertainty of some observables.},

We use molecular dynamics simulation data to build Markovian state models (MSMs), discrete representations of the pathways sampled. Using these MSMs, we can quickly calculate the folding probability (P(fold)) and mean first passage time of all the sampled points.

abstract = {To meet the challenge of modeling the conformational dynamics of biological macromolecules over long time scales, much recent effort has been devoted to constructing stochastic kinetic models, often in the form of discrete-state Markov models, from short molecular dynamics simulations. To construct useful models that faithfully represent dynamics at the time scales of interest, it is necessary to decompose configuration space into a set of kinetically metastable states. Previous attempts to define these states have relied upon either prior knowledge of the slow degrees of freedom or on the application of conformational clustering techniques which assume that conformationally distinct clusters are also kinetically distinct. Here, we present a first version of an automatic algorithm for the discovery of kinetically metastable states that is generally applicable to solvated macromolecules. Given molecular dynamics trajectories initiated from a well-defined starting distribution, the algorithm discovers long lived, kinetically metastable states through successive iterations of partitioning and aggregating conformation space into kinetically related regions. The authors apply this method to three peptides in explicit solvent-terminally blocked alanine, the 21-residue helical F(s) peptide, and the engineered 12-residue beta-hairpin trpzip2-to assess its ability to generate physically meaningful states and faithful kinetic models.},

abstract = {The effects of a single-point mutation on folding thermodynamics and kinetics are usually interpreted by focusing on the native structure and the transition state. Here, the entire conformational spaces of a 20-residue three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet peptide (double hairpin) and of its single-point mutant W10V are sampled close to the melting temperature by equilibrium folding-unfolding molecular dynamics simulations for a total of 40 micros. The folded state as well as the most populated free energy basins in the denatured state are isolated by grouping conformations according to fast relaxation at equilibrium. Such kinetic analysis provides more detailed and useful information than a simple projection of the free energy. The W10V mutant has the same native structure as the wild type peptide, and similar folding rate and stability. In the denatured state, the N-terminal hairpin is about 20% more structured in W10V than the wild type mainly because of van der Waals interactions. Notably, the W10V mutation influences also the van der Waals energy at the transition state ensemble causing a shift in the ratio of fluxes between two different transition state regions on parallel folding pathways corresponding to nucleation at either of the two beta-hairpins. Previous experimental studies have focused on the effects of denaturant-dependent or temperature-dependent changes in the structure of the denatured state. The atomistic simulations show that a single-point mutation in the central strand of a beta-sheet peptide results in remarkable changes in the topography of the denatured state ensemble. These changes modulate the relative accessibility of parallel folding pathways because of kinetic partitioning of the denatured state. Therefore, the observed dependence of the folding process on the starting ensemble raises questions on the biological significance of in vitro folding studies under strongly denaturing conditions.},

such as biomolecules via numerical integration or Monte Carlo is limited by the sampling problem. 
Alternatively, the dynamics of these systems can be modeled by transition networks (TNs) which are 
weighted graphs whose edges represent transitions between stable states of the system. The compu- 
tation of the globally best transition paths connecting two selected stable states is straightforward 
with available graph-theoretical methods. However, these methods require that the energy barriers 
of all TN edges be determined, which is often computationally infeasible for large systems. Here, 
we introduce energy-bounded TNs, in which the transition barriers are specified in terms of lower 
and upper bounds. We present algorithms permitting the determination of the globally best paths 
on these TNs while requiring the computation of only a small subset of the true transition barriers. 
Several variants of the algorithm are given which achieve improved performance, including a parallel 
version. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by various benchmarks on random TNs 
and by computing the refolding pathways of a polypeptide: the best transition pathways between 
the $\alpha$L helix, $\alpha$R helix, and $\beta$-hairpin conformations of the octaalanine (Ala8 ) molecule in aqueous

Characterization of the dynamics of unfolded proteins is therefore essential for the understanding of the earliest steps in protein folding. We used triplet-triplet energy transfer to measure formation of intrachain contacts in different unfolded polypeptide chains. The time constants (1/k) for contact formation over short distances are almost independent of chain length, with a maximum value of about 5 ns for flexible glycine-rich chains and of 12 ns for stiffer chains. The rates of contact formation over longer distances decrease with increasing chain length, indicating different rate-limiting steps for motions over short and long chain segments. The effect of the amino acid sequence on local chain dynamics was probed by using a series of host-guest peptides. Formation of local contacts is only sixfold slower around the stiffest amino acid (proline) compared to the most flexible amino acid (glycine). Good solvents for polypeptide chains like EtOH, GdmCl and urea were found to slow intrachain diffusion and to decrease chain stiffness. These data allow us to determine the time constants for formation of the earliest intrachain contacts during protein folding.},

Does water merely induce hydrophobic forces, or does the discrete nature of water play a structural role in folding? Are the nonadditive aspects of water important in determining the folding mechanism? To help to address these questions, we have performed simulations of the folding of a model protein (BBA5) in explicit solvent. Starting 10,000 independent trajectories from a fully unfolded conformation, we have observed numerous folding events, making this work a comprehensive study of the kinetics of protein folding starting from the unfolded state and reaching the folded state and with an explicit solvation model and experimentally validated rates. Indeed, both the raw TIP3P folding rate (4.5 +/- 2.5 micros) and the diffusion-constant corrected rate (7.5 +/- 4.2 micros) are in strong agreement with the experimentally observed rate of 7.5 +/- 3.5 micros. To address the role of water in folding, the mechanism is compared with that predicted from implicit solvation simulations.

abstract = {Previous molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the thermal denaturation of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) have provided atomic-resolution models of the transition state ensemble that is well supported by experimental studies. Here, we use simulations to further investigate the energy landscape around the transition state region. Nine structures within ~35 ps and 3 {\AA} C[alpha] RMSD of the transition state ensemble identified in a previous 498 K thermal denaturation simulation were quenched under the quasi-native conditions of 335 K and neutral pH. All of the structures underwent hydrophobically driven collapse in response to the drop in temperature. Structures less denatured than the transition state became structurally more native-like, while structures that were more denatured than the transition state tended to show additional loss of native structure. The structures in the immediate region of the transition state fluctuated between becoming more and less native-like. All of the starting structures had the same native-like topology and were quite similar (within 3.5 {\AA} C[alpha] RMSD). That the structures all shared native-like topology, yet diverged into either more or less native-like structures depending on which side of the transition state they occupied on the unfolding trajectory, indicates that topology alone does not dictate protein folding. Instead, our results suggest that a detailed interplay of packing interactions and interactions with water determine whether a partially denatured protein will become more native-like under refolding conditions.},

abstract = {Experimentally, protein engineering and phi-value analysis is the method of choice to characterize the structure in folding transition state ensemble (TSE) of any protein. Combining experimental phi values and computer simulations has led to a deeper understanding of how proteins fold. In this report, we construct the TSE of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 from published phi values. Importantly, we verify, by means of multiple independent simulations, that the conformations in the TSE have a probability of approximately 0.5 to reach the native state rapidly, so the TSE consists of true transition states. This finding validates the use of transition state theory underlying all phi-value analyses. Also, we present a method to dissect and study the TSE by generating conformations that have a disrupted alpha-helix (alpha-disrupted states) or disordered beta-strands 3 and 4 (beta-disrupted states). Surprisingly, the alpha-disrupted states have a stronger tendency to fold than the beta-disrupted states, despite the higher phi values for the alpha-helix in the TSE. We give a plausible explanation for this result and discuss its implications on protein folding and design. Our study shows that, by using both experiments and computer simulations, we can gain many insights into protein folding.},

The roles of individual residues in the folding nucleus are identified, and the order of events in the S6 folding mechanism is explored in detail. Interpretation of our results agrees with, and extends the utility of, experiments that shift phi-values by modulating denaturant concentration and presents strong evidence for the realism of the mechanistic details in our MC Go model and the structural interpretation of experimental phi-values. We also observe plasticity in the contacts of the hydrophobic core that support the specific nucleus. For S6, which binds to RNA and protein after folding, this plasticity may result from the conformational flexibility required to achieve biological function.

abstract = {Coarse-graining of protein interactions provides a means of simulating large biological systems. Here, a coarse-graining method, REACH, is introduced, in which the force constants of a residue-scale elastic network model are calculated from the variance-covariance matrix obtained from atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In test calculations, the C(alpha)-atoms variance-covariance matrices are calculated from the ensembles of 1-ns atomistic MD trajectories in monomeric and dimeric myoglobin, and used to derive coarse-grained force constants for the local and nonbonded interactions. Construction of analytical model functions of the distance-dependence of the interresidue force constants allows rapid calculation of the REACH normal modes. The model force constants from monomeric and dimeric myoglobin are found to be similar in magnitude to each other. The MD intra- and intermolecular mean-square fluctuations and the vibrational density of states are well reproduced by the residue-scale REACH normal modes without requiring rescaling of the force constant parameters. The temperature-dependence of the myoglobin REACH force constants reveals that the dynamical transition in protein internal fluctuations arises principally from softening of the elasticity in the nonlocal interactions. The REACH method is found to be a reliable way of determining spatiotemporal protein motion without the need for expensive computations of long atomistic MD simulations.},

The REACH (Realistic Extension Algorithm via Covariance Hessian) coarse-graining method, in which the force constants of a residue-scale elastic network model are calculated from the variance-covariance matrix obtained from atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, involves direct mapping between scales without the need for iterative optimization. Here, the transferability of the REACH force field is examined between protein molecules of different structural classes. As test cases, myoglobin (all alpha), plastocyanin (all beta), and dihydrofolate reductase (alpha/beta) are taken. The force constants derived are found to be closely similar in all three proteins. An MD version of REACH is presented, and low-temperature coarse-grained (CG) REACH MD simulations of the three proteins are compared with atomistic MD results. The mean-square fluctuations of the atomistic MD are well reproduced by the CGMD. Model functions for the CG interactions, derived by averaging over the three proteins, are also shown to produce fluctuations in good agreement with the atomistic MD. The results indicate that, similarly to the use of atomistic force fields, it is now possible to use a single, generic REACH force field for all protein studies, without having first to derive parameters from atomistic MD simulation for each individual system studied. The REACH method is thus likely to be a reliable way of determining spatiotemporal motion of a variety of proteins without the need for expensive computation of long atomistic MD simulations.},

In this review we discuss aspects of detailed atomic simulation methods applied to studies of protein folding free energy surfaces, using biased-sampling free energy methods and temperature-induced protein unfolding. We review studies from each on systems of particular experimental interest and assess the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in the context of "exact" results for both free energies and kinetics of a minimalist model for a beta-barrel protein. We illustrate in detail how each approach is implemented and discuss analysis methods that have been developed as components of these studies. We describe key insights into the relationship between protein topology and the folding mechanism emerging from folding free energy surface calculations. We further describe the determination of detailed "pathways" and models of folding transition states that have resulted from unfolding studies. Our assessment of the two methods suggests that both can provide, often complementary, details of folding mechanism and thermodynamics, but this success relies on (a) adequate sampling of diverse conformational regions for the biased-sampling free energy approach and (b) many trajectories at multiple temperatures for unfolding studies. Furthermore, we find that temperature-induced unfolding provides representatives of folding trajectories only when the topology and sequence (energy) provide a relatively funneled landscape and "off-pathway" intermediates do not exist.},

abstract = {In complex systems with many degrees of freedom such as peptides and proteins, there exists a huge number of local-minimum-energy states. Conventional simulations in the canonical ensemble are of little use, because they tend to get trapped in states of these energy local minima. A simulation in generalized ensemble performs a random walk in potential energy space and can overcome this difficulty. From only one simulation run, one can obtain canonical-ensemble averages of physical quantities as functions of temperature by the single-histogram and/or multiple-histogram reweighting techniques. In this article we review uses of the generalized-ensemble algorithms in biomolecular systems. Three well-known methods, namely, multicanonical algorithm, simulated tempering, and replica-exchange method, are described first. Both Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics versions of the algorithms are given. We then present three new generalized-ensemble algorithms that combine the merits of the above methods. The effectiveness of the methods for molecular simulations in the protein folding problem is tested with short peptide systems.},

It requires fewer trajectories than a single iteration of existing procedures, and it applies to both low and high friction dynamics. The new method screens a set of candidate collective variables for a good reaction coordinate that depends on a few relevant variables. The Bayesian information criterion determines whether additional variables significantly improve the reaction coordinate. Additionally, we present an advantageous transition path sampling algorithm and an algorithm to generate the most likely transition path in the space of collective variables. The method is demonstrated on two systems: a bistable model potential energy surface and nucleation in the Ising model. For the Ising model of nucleation, we quantify for the first time the role of nuclei surface area in the nucleation reaction coordinate. Surprisingly, increased surface area increases the stability of nuclei in two dimensions but decreases nuclei stability in three dimensions. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

This is due to its concerted mechanism, which requires an independent description of the three bonds that are being formed or broken. In this work, we have taken the advantage of a new and promising methodology to efficiently sample intrinsically multidimensional free-energy surfaces. We locate the lowest free-energy reaction path in the 3D configurational space and use this finite-temperature intrinsic reaction coordinate in an umbrella sampling scheme to access the temperature contributions to high accuracy. The small increase of the barrier and the decrease of the overall endothermicity for the E2 reaction due to entropic contributions is non-trivial. Moreover, our strategy to efficiently handle multiple reaction coordinates could be a great benefit to many chemistry-related fields, such as enzyme catalysis, reactions in solution, and nucleation processes.},

abstract = {A computational technique is proposed which combines the string method with a sampling technique to determine minimum free energy paths. The technique only requires to compute the mean force and another conditional expectation locally along the string, and therefore can be applied even if the number of collective variables kept in the free energy calculation is large. This is in contrast with other free energy sampling techniques which aim at mapping the full free energy landscape and whose cost increases exponentially with the number of collective variables kept in the free energy. Provided that the number of collective variables is large enough, the new technique captures the mechanism of transition in that it allows to determine the committor function for the reaction and, in particular, the transition state region. The new technique is illustrated on the example of alanine dipeptide, in which we compute the minimum free energy path for the isomerization transition using either two or four dihedral angles as collective variables. It is shown that the mechanism of transition can be captured using the four dihedral angles, but it cannot be captured using only two of them.},

abstract = {Transition states are defined as points in configuration space with the highest probability that trajectories passing through them are reactive (i.e., form transition paths between reactants and products). In the high-friction (diffusive) limit of Langevin dynamics, the resulting ensemble of transition states is shown to coincide with the separatrix formed by points of equal commitment (or splitting) probabilities for reaching the product and reactant regions. Transition states according to the new criterion can be identified directly from equilibrium trajectories, or indirectly by calculating probability densities in the equilibrium and transition-path ensembles using umbrella and transition-path sampling, respectively. An algorithm is proposed to calculate rate coefficients from the transition-path and equilibrium ensembles by estimating the frequency of transitions between reactants and products.},

These single-molecule approaches can directly resolve transient intermediate states and multiple reaction pathways, and thus are uniquely powerful in characterizing the complex dynamics of biological processes. Recent applications of these two techniques to the protein and RNA folding problems have led to exciting new results.},

abstract = {Several a priori tests of a systematic stochastic mode reduction procedure recently devised by the authors [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 96 (1999) 14687; Commun. Pure Appl. Math. 54 (2001) 891] are developed here. In this procedure, reduced stochastic equations for a smaller collections of resolved variables are derived systematically for complex nonlinear systems with many degrees of freedom and a large collection of unresolved variables. While the above approach is mathematically rigorous in the limit when the ratio of correlation times between the resolved and the unresolved variables is arbitrary small, it is shown here on a systematic hierarchy of models that this ratio can be surprisingly big. Typically, the systematic reduced stochastic modeling yields quantitatively realistic dynamics for ratios as large as 1/2. The examples studied here vary from instructive stochastic triad models to prototype complex systems with many degrees of freedom utilizing the truncated Burgers--Hopf equations as a nonlinear heat bath. Systematic quantitative tests for the stochastic modeling procedure are developed here which involve the stationary distribution and the two-time correlations for the second and fourth moments including the resolved variables and the energy in the resolved variables. In an important illustrative example presented here, the nonlinear original system involves 102 degrees of freedom and the reduced stochastic model predicted by the theory for two resolved variables involves both nonlinear interaction and multiplicative noises. Even for large value of the correlation time ratio of the order of 1/2, the reduced stochastic model with two degrees of freedom captures the essentially nonlinear and non-Gaussian statistics of the original nonlinear systems with 102 modes extremely well. Furthermore, it is shown here that the standard regression fitting of the second-order correlations alone fails to reproduce the nonlinear stochastic dynamics in this example. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, when there are many different pathways to go from one stable state to another, for example, when there are many saddle points in the free energy surface, it can be difficult to sample all possible pathways within the timescale of a single simulation. In this work, we demonstrate the use of parallel tempering to overcome this problem.},

This makes it difficult to objectively judge the precision of the structures. We used Bayesian inference to derive a probability distribution that represents the unknown structure and its precision. This probability distribution also determines additional un- knowns, such as theory parameters, that previously had to be chosen empiri- cally. We implemented this approach by using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Our method provides an objective figure of merit and improves structural quality.},

Here we show that, based on this approach, it is possible to predict the folding behaviour of RNA molecules by numerical integration. Comparison with stochastic folding simulations shows reasonable agreement of the resulting folding dynamics and a drastic increase in computational efficiency that makes it possible to investigate the folding dynamics of RNA of at least tRNA size. Our approach is readily applicable to bistable RNA molecules and promises to facilitate studies on the dynamic behaviour of RNA switches.},

abstract = {A new method for refining three-dimensional (3D) NMR structures of proteins is described, which takes account of the complete relaxation pathways. Derivatives of the NOE intensities with respect to the dihedral angles are analytically calculated, and efficiently evaluated with the use of a filter technique for identifying the dominant terms of these derivatives. This new method was implemented in the distance geometry pro- gram DIANA. As an initial test, we refined 30 rigid distorted helical structures, using a simulated data set of NOE distance constraints for a rigid standard or-helix. The final root-mean-square deviations of the refined structures relative to the standard helix were less than 0. I A, and the R-factors dropped from values between 7% and 32% to values of less than 0.5% in all cases, which compares favorably with the results from distance geometry calculations. In particular, because spin diffusion was not explicitly considered in the evaluation of 'exact' t H ~H distances corresponding to the simulated NOE intensities, a group of nearly identical distance geometry structures was obtained which had about 0.5/~ root-mean-square deviation from the standard ~t- helix. Further test calculations using an experimental NOE data set recorded for the protein trypsin inhibitor K showed that the complete relaxation matrix refinement procedure in the DIANA program is functional also with systems of practical interest.},

abstract = {We present a ``coarse molecular dynamics'' approach and apply it to studying the kinetics and thermodynamics of a peptide fragment dissolved in water. Short bursts of appropriately initialized simulations are used to infer the deterministic and stochastic components of the peptide motion parametrized by an appropriate set of coarse variables. Techniques from traditional numerical analysis (Newton-Raphson, coarse projective integration) are thus enabled; these techniques help analyze important features of the free-energy landscape (coarse transition states, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, transition rates, etc.). Reverse integration of coarse variables backward in time can assist escape from free energy minima and trace low-dimensional free energy surfaces. To illustrate the coarse molecular dynamics approach, we combine multiple short (0.5 ps) replica simulations to map the free energy surface of the ``alanine dipeptide'' in water, and to determine the similar to1/(1000 ps) rate of interconversion between the two stable configurational basins corresponding to the alpha-helical and extended minima.},

abstract = {ntropy and enthalpy compensation are frequently observed in thermodynamic measurements. To understand the molecular details of these compensating changes, molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo methods may, in principle, be used. Yet, in practice, computational methods to evaluate changes in entropy and enthalpy usually have much greater (e.g. order of magnitude worse) error than relative free energy calculations. In this paper, we examine ways to improve the computational ability to determine changes in both enthalpy and entropy. Toward that end we consider five different perturbation schemes for enthalpy determination and also consider the relative importance of staging the computation (i.e., dividing the entire perturbation calculation into a series of consecutive smaller ones) along the reaction coordinate. Two model systems are used for evaluation: a system of Lennard-Jones spheres, where the computation is directed to the addition/deletion of a sphere, and the alchemical transformation of an anion in explicit TIP3P water from one type to another. The results show only subtle differences among the better perturbation methods and much larger improvement in relative accuracy with the use and careful selection of staged intermediates along the reaction coordinate. As a result of these calculations, we suggest that approximate calculations of relative entropy be used to guide the staging of intermediates for computation of free energy, entropy, and enthalpy differences. We suggest that for these purposes the single state perturbation (SSP) method is the best choice. For the pure purpose of enthalpy and/or entropy evaluation, we suggest multistage SSP and direct approach, respectively, for systems with small and large differences.},

abstract = {We present and discuss a framework for computer-aided multiscale analysis, which enables models at a ``fine'' (microscopic/stochastic) level of description to perform modeling tasks at a ``coarse'' (macroscopic, systems) level. These macroscopic modeling tasks, yielding information over long time and large space scales, are accomplished through appropriately initialized calls to the microscopic simulator for only short times and small spatial domains. Our equation-free (EF) approach, when successful, can bypass the derivation of the macroscopic evolution equations when these equations conceptually exist but are not available in closed form. We discuss how the mathematics-assisted development of a computational superstructure may enable alternative descriptions of the problem physics (e.g. Lattice Boltzmann (LB), kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) or Molecular Dynamics (MD) microscopic simulators, executed over relatively short time and space scales) to perform systems level tasks (integration over relatively large time and space scales,``coarse'' bifurcation analysis, optimization, and control) directly. In effect, the procedure constitutes a systems identification based, ``closure on demand'' computational toolkit, bridging microscopic/stochastic simulation with traditional continuum scientific computation and numerical analysis. We illustrate these ideas through examples from chemical kinetics (LB, KMC), rheology (Brownian Dynamics), homogenization and the computation of ``coarsely self-similar'' solutions, and discuss various features, limitations and potential extensions of the approach.},

abstract = {Our understanding of the principles underlying the protein-folding problem can be tested by developing and characterizing simple models that make predictions which can be compared to experimental data. Here we extend our earlier model of folding free energy landscapes, in which each residue is considered to be either folded as in the native state or completely disordered, by investigating the role of additional factors representing hydrogen bonding and backbone torsion strain, and by using a hybrid between the master equation approach and the simple transition state theory to evaluate kinelics near the free energy barrier in greater detail. Model calculations of folding phi-values are compared to experimental data for 19 proteins, and for more than half of these, experimental data are reproduced with correlation coefficients between r = 0.41 and 0.88; calculations of transition state free energy barriers correlate with rates measured for 37 single domain proteins (r = 0.69). The model provides insight into the contribution of alternative-folding pathways, the validity of quasi-equilibrium treatments of the folding landscape, and the magnitude of the Arrhenius prefactor for protein folding. Finally, we discuss the limitations of simple native-state-based models, and as a more general test of such models, provide predictions of folding rates and mechanisms for a comprehensive set of over 400 small protein domains of known structure.},

abstract = {Markov state models (MSM) of molecular kinetics, used to approximate the long-time statistical dynamics of a molecule by a Markov chain on a discrete partition of configuration space, have seen widespread use in recent years. This thesis deals with the improved generation, validation, the application and the extension to experimental observations of these MSM. The four major parts each address different aspects: (1) a summary of the current state of the art in generation and validation of MSMs serving as an introduction along with some important insights into optimal discretization, (2) an investigation of efficient computation and error estimation of the committor, a widely used reaction coordinate, (3) the theory and application on how to generate markov models from multi-ensemble simulations such as parallel tempering using dynamical reweighting, and (4) the extension of MSM theory to non-markovian observations from low-dimensional observed correlations. All parts contain the necessary theory and methods and are applied to artificial and real systems along with an investigation into robustness and error. Thus, this work extends the quality of the computation of key properties and the general construction of markov models for molecular kinetics and allows to alleviate the gap in connecting estimations from simulation and experiment. This is an important step forward toward the long term goal to have the necessary robustness and accuracy for upcoming adaptive MD simulation strategies.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional vector fields undergoing a Hopf bifurcation are studied in a Liouville-equation approach, The Liouville equation rules the time evolution of statistical ensembles of trajectories issued from random initial conditions. but evolving under the deterministic dynamics. The time evolution of the probability densities of such statistical ensembles can be decomposed in terms of the spectrum of the resonances (i.e., the relaxation rates) of the Liouvillian operator or the related Frobenius-Perron operator. The spectral decomposition of the Liouvillian operator is explicitly constructed before, at, and after the Hopf bifurcation. Because of the emergence of time oscillations near the Hopf bifurcation, the resonance spectrum turns out to be complex and defined by both relaxation rates and oscillation frequencies. The resonance spectrum is discrete far from the bifurcation and becomes continuous at the bifurcation. This continuous spectrum is caused by the critical slowing down of the oscillations occurring at the Hopf bifurcation and it leads to power-law relaxation as 1/roott of the probability densities and statistical averages at long times t-->infinity. Moreover. degeneracy in the resonance spectrum is shown to yield a Jordan-block structure in the spectral decomposition.},

abstract = {For classical systems with anharmonic forces, Newton's equations for particle trajectories are nonlinear, while Liouville's equation for the evolution of functions of position and momentum is linear and is solved by constructing a basis of functions in which the Liouvillian is a tridiagonal matrix, which is then diagonalized. For systems that are chaotic in the sense that neighboring trajectories diverge exponentially, the initial conditions determine the solution to Liouville's equation for short times; but for long times, the solutions decay exponentially at rates independent of the initial conditions. These are the relaxation rates of irreversible processes, and they arise in these calculations as the imaginary parts of the frequencies where there are singularities in the analytic continuations of solutions to Liouville's equation. These rates are calculated for two examples: the inverted oscillator, which can be solved both analytically and numerically, and a charged particle in a periodic magnetic field, which can only be solved numerically. In these systems, dissipation arises from traveling-wave solutions to Liouville's equation that couple low and high wave-number modes allowing energy to flow from disturbances that are coherent over large scales to disturbances on ever smaller scales finally becoming incoherent over microscopic scales. These results suggest that dissipation in large scale motion of the system is a consequence of chaos in the small scale motion.},

We describe the motion of the polyions using a modified form of the Langevin equation to include the effects of the electrostatic field. The polyion diffusion coefficient is shown to be increased by this interaction and rough calculations indicate that this increase may be significant (≈10%). A computer simulation technique, similar to the molecular dynamics method, is proposed for a quantitative study of this effect.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Understanding the relationship between the amino acid sequence of a protein and its unique, compact 3D structure is one of the grand challenges in molecular biophysics. One particularly exciting approach is time-resolved electronic circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, which offers resolution on a nanosecond (or faster) time scale, although it does not provide the spatial resolution of techniques like X-ray crystallography or NMR. The thrust of our work is to underpin fast time scale spec- troscopic studies of protein folding with a stronger theoretical foundation. Ultimately, we seek to use molecular dynamics simulations to study the influence of conformational dynamics and conformational transitions on the electronic CD spectra of proteins. We discuss how improved quantum chemical models of individual chromophores, including aromatic sidechains, can be incorporated into calculations of the electronic structure of proteins and their CD.

abstract = {Experimental variables of optical tweezers instrumentation that affect RNA folding/unfolding kinetics were investigated. A model RNA hairpin, P5ab, was attached to two micron-sized beads through hybrid RNA/DNA handles; one bead was trapped by dual-beam lasers and the other was held by a micropipette. Several experimental variables were changed while measuring the unfolding/refolding kinetics, including handle lengths, trap stiffness, and modes of force applied to the molecule. In constant-force mode where the tension applied to the RNA was maintained through feedback control, the measured rate coefficients varied within 40% when the handle lengths were changed by 10-fold (1.1-10.2 Kbp); they increased by two- to threefold when the trap stiffness was lowered to one-third (from 0.1 to 0.035 pN/nm). In the passive mode, without feedback control and where the force applied to the RNA varied in response to the end-to-end distance change of the tether, the RNA hopped between a high-force folded-state and a low-force unfolded-state. In this mode, the rates increased up to twofold with longer handles or softer traps. Overall, the measured rates remained with the same order-of-magnitude over the wide range of conditions studied. In the companion article on pages 3010-3021, we analyze how the measured kinetics parameters differ from the intrinsic molecular rates of the RNA, and thus how to obtain the molecular rates.},

We state upper bounds on the 2nd eigenvalue for restriction and stochastic complementation chains of reversible Markov chains, as well as a relation between them. We illustrate the obtained bounds analytically for bunkbed graphs, and furthermore apply them to restricted Markov chains that arise when analyzing conformation dynamics of a small biomolecule.},

abstract = {The recently described molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method for calculating free energies is applied to a congeneric series of 16 ligands to p38 MAP kinase whose binding constants span approximately 2 orders of magnitude. These compounds have previously been used to test and compare other free energy calculation methods, including thermodynamic integration (TI), OWFEG, ChemScore, PLPScore, and Dock Energy Score. We find that the MM-PBSA performs relatively poorly for this set of ligands, yielding results much inferior to those from TI or OWFEG, inferior to Dock Energy Score, and not appreciably better than ChemScore or PLPScore but at an appreciably larger computational cost than any of these other methods. This suggests that one should be selective in applying the MM-PBSA method and that for systems that are amenable to other free energy approaches, these other approaches may be preferred. We also examine the single simulation approximation for MM- PBSA, whereby the required ligand and protein trajectories are extracted from a single MD simulation rather than two separate MD runs. This assumption, sometimes used to speed the MM-PBSA calculation, is found to yield significantly inferior results with only a moderate net percentage reduction in total simulation time.},

For time integration, the implicit trapezoidal rule is employed, where an explicit predictor enables large time steps. Error estimators for both the temporal and spatial discretization are advocated, and facilitate a fully adaptive propagation. The framework is developed and exemplified in the context of the classical Liouville equation, where Gaussian phase-space packets are used as particles. Simplified variants are discussed briefly. The concept is illustrated by numerical examples for one-dimensional dynamics in double well potential.},

abstract = {The efficiencies of two recently developed methods for calculating free energy changes along a generalized coordinate in a system are discussed in the context of other, related approaches. One method is based on Jarzynski's identity [Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 2690 (1997)]. The second method relies on thermodynamic integration of the average force and is called the adaptive biasing force method [Darve and Pohorille, J. Chem. Phys. 115, 9169 (2001)]. Both methods are designed such that the system evolves along the chosen coordinate(s) without experiencing free energy barriers and they require calculating the instantaneous, unconstrained force acting on this coordinate using the formula derived by Darve and Pohorille. Efficiencies are analyzed by comparing analytical estimates of statistical errors and by considering two numerical examples-internal rotation of hydrated 1,2-dichloroethane and transfer of fluoromethane across a water-hexane interface. The efficiencies of both methods are approximately equal in the first but not in the second case. During transfer of fluoromethane the system is easily driven away from equilibrium and, therefore, the performance of the method based on Jarzynski's identity is poor.},

abstract = {The free energy difference between two states of a molecular system separated by an energy barrier can generally be computed using the technique of umbrella sampling along a chosen reaction coordinate or pathway. The effect of a particular choice of pathway upon the obtained free energy difference is investigated by molecular dynamics simulation of a model system consisting of a glycine dipeptide in aqueous solution. Two different reaction coordinates connecting the so-called C-5 and C-7 conformations, one involving intramolecular hydrogen bonds and the other involving the peptide phi,psi angles, are considered. The Gibbs free energy differences Delta G(C-5 - C-7) are small in both cases, 1.5 +/- 1 kJ mol(-1) and 2.2 +/- 1 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The two different reaction coordinates yield free energy differences that are identical to within their statistical error. It is found that the exchange of solute-solute, solute-water, and water-water hydrogen bonds involves free energy changes of less than k(B)T, which points at the existence of a multitude of low free energy pathways connecting the C-5 and C-7 dipeptide conformations.},

abstract = {Abstract Molecular dynamics simulations rely on integrating the classical (Newtonian) equations of motion for a molecular system and thus, sample a microcanonical (constant-energy) ensemble by default. However, for compatibility with experiment, it is often desirable to sample configurations from a canonical (constant-temperature) ensemble instead. A modification of the basic molecular dynamics scheme with the purpose of maintaining the temperature constant (on average) is called a thermostat algorithm. The present article reviews the various thermostat algorithms proposed to date, their physical basis, their advantages and their shortcomings. Computer simulation, Molecular dynamics, Canonical ensemble, Thermostat algorithm This revised version was published online in March 2005. Previuosly, this chapter was inadvertently published online as part of volume 176.},

We further suggest that the evolution of amino acid sequences should favor multiple paths to the folded state. Existing physicochemical and mutational data are not inconsistent with a many-pathway model. The analogy of a jigsaw puzzle, with multiple routes to a unique solution, appears to be particularly apt.},

abstract = {In many applications, the primary objective of numerical simulation of time-evolving systems is the prediction of macroscopic, or coarse-grained, quantities. A representative example is the prediction of biomolecular conformations from molecular dynamics. In recent years a number of new algorithmic approaches have been introduced to extract effective, lower-dimensional, models for the macroscopic dynamics; the starting point is the full, detailed, evolution equations. In many cases the effective low-dimensional dynamics may be stochastic, even when the original starting point is deterministic. This review surveys a number of these new approaches to the problem of extracting effective dynamics, highlighting similarities and differences between them. The importance of model problems for the evaluation of these new approaches is stressed, and a number of model problems are described. When the macroscopic dynamics is stochastic, these model problems are either obtained through a clear separation of time-scales, leading to a stochastic effect of the fast dynamics on the slow dynamics, or by considering high dimensional ordinary differential equations which, when projected onto a low dimensional subspace, exhibit stochastic behaviour through the presence of a broad frequency spectrum. Models whose stochastic microscopic behaviour leads to deterministic macroscopic dynamics are also introduced. The algorithms we overview include SVD-based methods for nonlinear problems, model reduction for linear control systems, optimal prediction techniques, asymptotics-based mode elimination, coarse timestepping methods and transfer-operator based methodologies.},

abstract = {Uncoupling-coupling Monte Carlo (UCMC) combines uncoupling techniques for finite Markov chains with Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology. UCMC aims at avoiding the typical metastable or trapping behavior of Monte Carlo techniques. From the viewpoint of Monte Carlo, a slowly converging long-time Markov chain is replaced by a limited number of rapidly mixing short-time ones. Therefore, the state space of the chain has to be hierarchically decomposed into its metastable conformations. This is done by means of combining the technique of conformation analysis as recently introduced by the authors, and appropriate annealing strategies. We present a detailed examination of the uncoupling-coupling procedure which uncovers its theoretical background, and illustrates the hierarchical algorithmic approach. Furthermore, application of the UCMC algorithm to the n-pentane molecule allows us to discuss the effect of its crucial steps in a typical molecular scenario.},

abstract = {The topic of the present paper has been motivated by a recent computational approach to identify metastable chemical conformations and patterns of conformational changes within molecular systems, After proper discretization, such conformations show up as almost invariant aggregates in reversible, nearly uncoupled Markov chains (NUMCs). Most of the former work on this subject treated the direct problem: given the aggregates, analyze the loose coupling in connection with the computation of the stationary distribution (aggregation/disaggregation techniques). In contrast to that, the present paper focuses on the inverse problem: given the system as a whole, identify the almost invariant aggregates together with the (small) probabilities of transitions between them. A robust algorithm is worked out on the basis of some detailed perturbation analysis and illustrated at a simple molecular system.},

abstract = {To understand how a protein folds is a problem which has important biological implications. In this article, we would like to present a physics-oriented point of view, which is twofold. First of all, we introduce simple statistical mechanics models which display, in the thermodynamic limit, folding and related transitions. These models can be divided into (i) crude spin glass-like models (with their Mattis analogs), where one may look for possible correlations between the chain self-interactions and the folded structure, (ii) glass-like models, where one emphasizes the geometrical competition between one- or two-dimensional local order (mimicking alpha helix or beta sheet structures), and the requirement of global compactness. Both models are too simple to predict the spatial organization of a realistic protein, but are useful for the physicist and should have some feedback in other glassy systems (glasses, collapsed polymers,...). These remarks lead us to the second physical approach, namely a new Monte-Carlo method, where one grows the protein atom-by-atom (or residue-by-residue), using a standard form (CHARMM,...) for the total energy. A detailed comparison with other Monte-Carlo schemes, or Molecular Dynamics calculations, is then possible; we will sketch such a comparison for poly-alanines. Our twofold approach illustrates some of the difficulties one encounters in the protein folding problem, in particular those associated with the existence of a large number of metastable states.},

abstract = {A unique feature of chemical catalysis mediated by enzymes is that the catalytically reactive atoms are embedded within a folded protein. Although current understanding of enzyme function has been focused on the chemical reactions and static three-dimensional structures, the dynamic nature of proteins has been proposed to have a function in catalysis1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The concept of conformational substates has been described6; however, the challenge is to unravel the intimate linkage between protein flexibility and enzymatic function. Here we show that the intrinsic plasticity of the protein is a key characteristic of catalysis. The dynamics of the prolyl cis--trans isomerase cyclophilin A (CypA) in its substrate-free state and during catalysis were characterized with NMR relaxation experiments. The characteristic enzyme motions detected during catalysis are already present in the free enzyme with frequencies corresponding to the catalytic turnover rates. This correlation suggests that the protein motions necessary for catalysis are an intrinsic property of the enzyme and may even limit the overall turnover rate. Motion is localized not only to the active site but also to a wider dynamic network. Whereas coupled networks in proteins have been proposed previously3, 7, 8, 9, 10, we experimentally measured the collective nature of motions with the use of mutant forms of CypA. We propose that the pre-existence of collective dynamics in enzymes before catalysis is a common feature of biocatalysts and that proteins have evolved under synergistic pressure between structure and dynamics.},

abstract = {A distribution of conformations of heptaalanine is obtained using a new Monte Carlo (MC) method that grows the chain atom by atom. Resulting configurations are energy minimized and a detailed analysis is performed of the minimum-energy conformers using a method of classification that partitions phipsi space. The MC-generated configurations are compared with those generated from high-temperature molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It is found that the new method generates a wide distribution of low-energy conformers at least 10 times more quickly than the MD. An analysis of the generated energy minima demonstrates that they can be divided into clusters in the space defined by the five pairs of phi-psi angles of the inner residues. The space occupied by the minima populating each cluster is restricted.},

abstract = {We have used distributed computing techniques and a supercluster of thousands of computer processors to study folding of the C-terminal beta -hairpin from protein G in atomistic detail using the GB/SA implicit solvent model at 300 K. We have simulated a total of nearly 38 mus of, folding time and obtained eight complete and independent folding trajectories. Starting from an extended state, we observe relaxation to an unfolded state characterized by non-specific, temporary hydrogen bonding. This is followed by the appearance of interactions between hydrophobic residues that stabilize a bent intermediate. Final formation of the complete hydrophobic core occurs cooperatively at the same time that the final hydrogen bonding pattern appears. The folded hairpin structures we observe all contain a closely packed hydrophobic core and proper beta -sheet backbone dihedral angles, but they differ in backbone hydrogen bonding pattern. We show that this is consistent with the existing experimental data on the hairpin alone in solution. Our analysis also reveals short-lived semi-helical intermediates which define a thermodynamic trap. Our results are consistent with a three-state mechanism with a single rate-limiting step in which a varying final hydrogen bond pattern is apparent, and senmi-helical off-pathway intermediates may appear early in the folding process. We include details of the ensemble dynamics methodology and a discussion of our achievements using this new computational device for studying dynamics at the atomic level.},

Phys. 81, 3684 (1984)] is analyzed. Using a generalized Liouville equation, an approximate equilibrium distribution function in the configurational space for the WC thermostat is obtained. From this distribution function, fluctuation formulas associated with the constant volume specific heat C-upsilon, pressure coefficient gamma(upsilon), and isothermal compressibility beta(T) are obtained. The validity of the derived distribution function and the fluctuation formulas were examined in a Lennard-Jones fluid. C-upsilon and gamma(upsilon) calculated from the formulas for the WC thermostat agree very well with those obtained in the canonical or microcanonical MD. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

In contrast to linear response theory, these expressions are exact no matter the strength of the perturbation, or how far the system has been driven away from equilibrium. In this paper, I show that these three relations (and several other closely related results) can all be considered special cases of a single theorem. This expression is explicitly derived for discrete time and space Markovian dynamics, with the additional assumptions that the unperturbed dynamics preserve the appropriate equilibrium ensemble, and that the energy of the system remains finite.},

abstract = {A common technique for the numerical calculation of free energies involves estimation of the probability density along a given coordinate from a set of configurations generated via simulation. The process requires discretization of one or more reaction coordinates to generate a histogram from which the continuous probability density is inferred. We show that the finite size of the intervals used to construct the histogram leads to quantifiable systematic error. The width of these intervals also determines the statistical error in the free energy, and the choice of the appropriate interval is therefore driven by the need to balance the two sources of error. We present a method for the construction of the optimal histogram for a given system, and show that the use of this technique requires little additional computational expense. We demonstrate the efficacy of the technique for a model system, and discuss how the principles governing the choice of discretization interval could be used to improve extended sampling techniques.},

abstract = {''Statistical potentials'' are energies widely used in computer algorithms to fold, dock, or recognize protein structures. They are derived from: (1) observed pairing frequencies of the 20 amino acids in databases of known protein structures, and (2) approximations and assumptions about the physical process that these quantities measure. Using exact lattice models, we construct a rigorous test of these assumptions and approximations. We find that statistical potentials often correctly rank-order the relative strengths of interresidue interactions, but they do not reflect the true underlying energies because of systematic errors arising from the neglect of excluded volume in proteins. We find that complex residue-residue distance dependences observed in statistical potentials, even those among charged groups, can be largely explained as an indirect consequence of the burial of non-polar groups. Our results suggest that current statistical potentials may have limited value in protein folding algorithms and wherever they are used to provide energy-like quantities.},

This technique has recently been proposed for the efficient computation of biomolecular conformations. One crucial step of UC is the decomposition of reversible nearly uncoupled Markov chains into rapidly mixing subchains. We show how the underlying scheme of uncoupling-coupling can also be applied to stochastic differential equations where it can be translated into a domain decomposition technique for partial differential equations.},

This general and exact result extends to the dynamical realm recently derived connections between thermodynamic free energies and statistics out of equilibrium. In the context of chemical kinetics, we use the identity to compute reaction rate constants through appropriate averaging of an effective work to switch from non-reactive to reactive trajectory ensembles.},

abstract = {A molecular model for urea to be used in conjunction with the simple point charge (SPC) model for liquid water in protein denaturation studies is validated by comparison of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results to experimental data at 298 K as a function of urea mole fraction. The density, enthalpy of mixing, free enthalpy of urea hydration, and urea diffusion show very good agreement with the experimental values. The experimental error in the free enthalpy of hydration, which is dominated by the inaccuracy of the Vapor pressure of solid urea, is larger than the simulation error. This limited accuracy does not allow a check of the nonideality of the solution. Free enthalpies have been obtained by thermodynamic integration. The importance of a correct use of the combinatorial factor in the partition function when interpreting simulation results obtained by thermodynamic integration is discussed. The tested, GROMOS96 compatible, force field parameters form a good basis for biomolecular simulations using urea-water mixtures.},

abstract = {A principal component analysis has been applied on equilibrium simulations of a beta-heptapeptide that shows reversible folding in a methanol solution. The analysis shows that the configurational space contains only three dense sub-states. These states of relatively low free energy correspond to the "native" left-handed helix, a partly helical intermediate, and a hairpin-like structure. The collection of unfolded conformations form a relatively diffuse cloud with little substructure. Internal hydrogen-bonding energies were found to correlate well with the degree of folding. The native helical structure folds from the N terminus; the transition from the major folding intermediate to the native helical structure involves the formation of the two most C-terminal backbone hydrogen bonds. A four-state Markov model was found to describe transition frequencies between the conformational states within error limits, indicating that memory-effects are negligible beyond the nanosecond time-scale. The dominant native state fluctuations were found to be very similar to unfolding motions, suggesting that unfolding pathways can be inferred from fluctuations in the native state. The low-dimensional essential subspace, describing 69% of the collective atomic fluctuations, was found to converge at time-scales of the order of one nanosecond at all temperatures investigated, whereas folding/unfolding takes place at significantly longer time-scales, even above the melting temperature.},

abstract = {In this article, we investigate molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of a butane molecule, as obtained using different types of thermostats. Results show that at low temperature. where the harmonic approximation holds, the Nose'-Hoover (NH) thermostat fails to reproduce the statistical mechanical behavior, even using simulation lengths of millions of time steps, whereas the Gaussian isokinetic (IG) thermostat reproduces quite well the expected statistical mechanical values. The Berendsen's coupling (BC) provides good results for basic properties such as the average potential and kinetic energies but fails in reproducing the canonical fluctuations. Moreover, using the speed of divergence of initially nearby trajectories in phase space as a measure of the dynamical chaoticity, we found that the NH thermostat provides very slow divergence for the physical phase space degrees of freedom, concentrating most of its chaoticity in the dynamics of the thermostat virtual degree of freedom. On the contrary, the IG thermostat provides always highly diverging trajectories in phase space, characterized by a high chaoticity of each degree of freedom. Finally, the BC thermostat provides a moderate chaotic behavior for all of the degrees of freedom. Such results suggest that even assuming for both the ``rigorous'' algorithms (NH and IG) a full ergodic behavior the NH thermostat could require an extremely long time to achieve convergence of the time averaged properties.

We propose a new definition of Helfand moment which takes into account the minimum image convention used in molecular dynamics with periodic boundary conditions. Our Helfand-moment method is equivalent to the method based on the Green-Kubo formula and is not affected by ambiguities due to the periodic boundary conditions. Moreover, in hard-ball systems, our method is equivalent to that developed by Alder, Gass, and Wainwright [J. Chem. Phys. 53, 3813 (1970)]. We apply and verify our method in a fluid composed of Ngreater than or equal to2 hard disks in elastic collisions. We show that the viscosity coefficients already take values in good agreement with Enskog's theory for N=2 hard disks in a hexagonal geometry.},

abstract = {We show that time-correlation functions of arbitrary order for any random variable in a statistical dynamical system can be calculated as higher-order response functions of the mean history of the variable. The response is to a ``control term'' added as a modification to the master equation for statistical distributions. The proof of the relations is based upon a variational characterization of the generating functional of the time correlations. The same fluctuation-response relations are preserved within moment closures for the statistical dynamical system, when these are constructed via the variational Rayleigh-Ritz procedure. For the two-time correlations of the moment variables themselves, the fluctuation-response relation is equivalent to an ``Onsager regression hypothesis'' for the small fluctuations. For correlations of higher order, there is a further effect in addition to such linear propagation of fluctuations present instantaneously: the dynamical generation of correlations by nonlinear interaction of fluctuations. In general, we discuss some physical and mathematical aspects of the Ansatze required for an accurate calculation of the time correlations. We also comment briefly upon the computational use of these relations, which is well suited for automatic differentiation tools. An example will be given of a simple closure for turbulent energy decay, which illustrates the numerical application of the relations.},

abstract = {We introduce a variational method for approximating distribution functions of dynamics with a ``Liouville operator'' L, in terms of a nonequilibrium action functional for two independent left and right trial states. The method is valid for deterministic or stochastic Markov dynamics and for stationary or time-dependent distributions. A practical Rayleigh-Ritz procedure is advanced, whose inputs are a finitely parametrized Ansatz for the trial states, leading to a parametric action for their evolution. The Euler-Lagrange equations of the action principle are Hamiltonian in form generally noncanonical. This permits a simple identification of fixed points as critical points of the parametric Hamiltonian. We also establish a variational principle for low-order statistics, such as mean values and correlation functions, by means of the least effective action. The latter is a functional of the given variable, which is positive and convex as a consequence of Holder realizability inequalities. Its value measures the cost for a fluctuation from the average to occur and in a weak-noise limit it reduces to the Onsager-Machlup action. In general, the effective action is shown to arise from the nonequilibrium action functional by a constrained variation. This result provides a Rayleigh-Ritz scheme for calculating just the desired low-order statistics, with internal consistency checks less demanding than for the full distribution.},

A method is described to realize coupling to an external bath with constant temperature or pressure with adjustable time constants for the coupling. The method is easily extendable to other variables and to gradients, and can be applied also to polyatomic molecules involving internal constraints. The influence of coupling time constants on dynamical variables is evaluated. A leap-frog algorithm is presented for the general case involving constraints with coupling to both a constant temperature and a constant pressure bath.},

abstract = {We describe a statistical approach to the validation and improvement of molecular dynamics simulations of macromolecules. We emphasize the use of molecular dynamics simulations to calculate thermodynamic quantities that may be compared to experimental measurements, and the use of a common set of energetic parameters across multiple distinct molecules. We briefly review relevant results from the theory of stochastic processes and discuss the monitoring of convergence to equilibrium, the obtaining of confidence intervals for summary statistics corresponding to measured quantities, and an approach to validation and improvement of simulations based on out-of-sample prediction. We apply these methods to replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of a set of eight helical peptides under the AMBER potential using implicit solvent. We evaluate the ability of these simulations to quantitatively reproduce experimental helicity measurements obtained by circular dichroism. In addition, we introduce notions of statistical predictive estimation for force-field parameter refinement. We perform a sensitivity analysis to identify key parameters of the potential, and introduce Bayesian updating of these parameters. We demonstrate the effect of parameter updating applied to the internal dielectric constant parameter on the out-of-sample prediction accuracy as measured by cross-validation.},

Here, we present a methodology comprising the use of an extended quasi-Gaussian entropy theory parametrized using molecular dynamics simulation that provides a complete description of the thermodynamics of peptide conformational states. The strategy is applied to analyze the conformational thermodynamics of MR121-GSGSW, a peptide well characterized in experimental studies. The results demonstrate that the extended state of the peptide possesses the lowest partial molar entropy. The origin of this entropy decrease is found to be in the increase of the density and orientational order of the hydration water molecules around the peptide, induced by the ``unfolding''. While such a reduction of the configurational entropy is usually associated with the hydrophobic effect, it is here found to be mainly due to the interaction of t...},

abstract = {The role of polypeptide collapse and formation of intermediates in protein folding is still under debate. Miniproteins, small globular peptide structures, serve as ideal model systems to study the basic principles that govern folding. Experimental investigations of folding dynamics of such small systems, however, turn out to be challenging, because requirements for high temporal and spatial resolution have to be met simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate how selective quenching of an extrinsic fluorescent label by the amino acid tryptophan (Trp) can be used to probe folding dynamics of Trp-cage (TC), the smallest protein known to date. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we monitor folding transitions as well as conformational flexibility in the denatured state of the 20-residue protein under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions with nanosecond time resolution. Besides microsecond folding kinetics, we reveal hierarchical folding of TC, hidden to previous experimental studies. We show that specific collapse of the peptide to a molten globule-like intermediate enhances folding efficiency considerably. A single point mutation destabilizes the intermediate, switching the protein to two-state folding behavior and slowing down the folding process. Our results underscore the importance of preformed structure in the denatured state for folding of even the smallest globular structures. A unique method emerges for monitoring conformational dynamics and ultrafast folding events of polypeptides at the nanometer scale.},

abstract = {Markovian state models (MSMs) are a convenient and efficient means to compactly describe the kinetics of a molecular system as well as a formalism for using many short simulations to predict long time scale behavior. Building a MSM consists of grouping the conformations into states and estimating the transition probabilities between these states. In a previous paper, we described an efficient method for calculating the uncertainty due to finite sampling in the mean first passage time between two states. In this paper, we extend the uncertainty analysis to derive similar closed-form solutions for the distributions of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transition matrix, quantities that have numerous applications when using the model. We demonstrate the accuracy of the distributions on a six-state model of the terminally blocked alanine peptide. We also show how to significantly reduce the total number of simulations necessary to build a model with a given precision using these uncertainty estimates for the blocked alanine system and for a 2454-state MSM for the dynamics of the villin headpiece.},

abstract = {Three recently proposed constant temperature molecular dynamics methods by: (i) Nos{\'e} (Mol. Phys., to be published); (ii) Hoover et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 48, 1818 (1982)], and Evans and Morriss [Chem. Phys. 77, 63 (1983)]; and (iii) Haile and Gupta [J. Chem. Phys. 79, 3067 (1983)] are examined analytically via calculating the equilibrium distribution functions and comparing them with that of the canonical ensemble. Except for effects due to momentum and angular momentum conservation, method (1) yields the rigorous canonical distribution in both momentum and coordinate space. Method (2) can be made rigorous in coordinate space, and can be derived from method (1) by imposing a specific constraint. Method (3) is not rigorous and gives a deviation of order N−1/2 from the canonical distribution (N the number of particles). The results for the constant temperature--constant pressure ensemble are similar to the canonical ensemble case.},

abstract = {It is difficult to investigate folding kinetics by conventional atomistic simulations of proteins. The replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulation technique enhances conformational sampling at the expenses of reduced kinetic information, which in REMD is directly available only for very short time scales. Here, we propose a procedure for obtaining kinetic data from REMD by making use of the equilibrium transitions network (ETN) sampled at the temperature of interest. This information is supplemented by mean folding times extracted from ETNs at higher REMD temperatures and scaled according to the Arrhenius equation. The procedure is applied to a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet peptide which has a very heterogeneous denatured state with a broad entropic basin and several enthalpic traps. Despite the complexity of the system and the REMD exchange time of only 0.1 ns, the procedure is able to estimate folding times (ranging from about 0.1 micros at the melting temperature of 330 K to about 8 micros at 286 K) as well as transition times from individual non-native basins to the native state.},

abstract = {An ultrarapid-mixing continuous-flow method has been developed to study submillisecond folding of chemically denatured proteins. Turbulent flow created by pumping solutions through a small gap dilutes the denaturant in tens of microseconds. We have used this method to study cytochrome c folding kinetics in the previously inaccessible time range 80 micros to 3 ms. To eliminate the heme-ligand exchange chemistry that complicates and slows the folding kinetics by trapping misfolded structures, measurements were made with the imidazole complex. Fluorescence quenching due to excitation energy transfer from the tryptophan to the heme was used to monitor the distance between these groups. The fluorescence decrease is biphasic. There is an unresolved process with tau < 50 micros, followed by a slower, exponential process with tau = 600 micros at the lowest denaturant concentration (0.2 M guanidine hydrochloride). These kinetics are interpreted as a barrier-free, partial collapse to the new equilibrium unfolded state at the lower denaturant concentration, followed by slower crossing of a free energy barrier separating the unfolded and folded states. The results raise several fundamental issues concerning the dynamics of collapse and barrier crossings in protein folding.},

abstract = {The folding thermodynamics and kinetics of the Pin WW domain, a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, have been characterized extensively. Folding and activation free energies were determined as a function of temperature for 16 mutants, which sample all strands and turns of the molecule. The mutational phi value (Phi(m)) diagram is a smooth function of sequence, indicating a prevalence of local interactions in the transition state (TS). At 37 degrees C, the diagram has a single pronounced maximum at turn 1: the rate-limiting step during folding is the formation of loop 1. In contrast, key residues for thermodynamic stability are located in the strand hydrophobic clusters, indicating that factors contributing to protein stability and folding kinetics are not correlated. The location of the TS along the entropic reaction coordinate Phi(T), obtained by temperature-tuning the kinetics, reveals that sufficiently destabilizing mutants in loop 2 or in the Leu7-Trp11-Tyr24-Pro37 hydrophobic cluster can cause a switch to a late TS. Phi(m) analysis is usually applied "perturbatively" (methyl truncation), but with Phi(T) to quantitatively assess TS shifts along a reaction coordinate, more severe mutations can be used to probe regions of the free energy surface beyond the TS.},

The copolymeric character of protein molecules is incorporated into the model in the form of specificities of inter-unit interactions. This model proved most effective for studying the statistical mechanical characteristics of protein folding, unfolding and fluctuations. The specificities of inter-unit interactions are shown to be the primary factors responsible for the all-or-none type transition from native to denatured states of globular proteins. The model has been studied by the Monte Carlo method of Metropolis et al., which is now shown applied to approximately simulating a kinetic process. In the strong limit of the specificity of the inter-unit interaction the native conformation was reached in this method by starting from an extended conformation. The possible generalization and application of this method for finding the native conformation of proteins form their amino sequence are discussed.},

abstract = {Markov state models (MSMs) are a powerful tool for modeling both the thermodynamics and kinetics of molecular systems. In addition, they provide a rigorous means to combine information from multiple sources into a single model and to direct future simulations/experiments to minimize uncertainties in the model. However, constructing MSMs is challenging because doing so requires decomposing the extremely high dimensional and rugged free energy landscape of a molecular system into long-lived states, also called metastable states. Thus, their application has generally required significant chemical intuition and hand-tuning. To address this limitation we have developed a toolkit for automating the construction of MSMs called MSMBUILDER (available at https://simtk.org/home/msmbuilder). In this work we demonstrate the application of MSMBUILDER to the villin headpiece (HP-35 NleNle), one of the smallest and fastest folding proteins. We show that the resulting MSM captures both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the original molecular dynamics of the system. As a first step toward experimental validation of our methodology we show that our model provides accurate structure prediction and that the longest timescale events correspond to folding.},

Here, we discuss the method in detail and position it in the context of maximum likelihood inference of generators from discretely sampled data. Furthermore, we show how the approach can be generalized to estimation from data sampled at nonconstant time intervals.

abstract = {Characterizing the equilibrium ensemble of folding pathways, including their relative probability, is one of the major challenges in protein folding theory today. Although this information is in principle accessible via all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, it is difficult to compute in practice because protein folding is a rare event and the affordable simulation length is typically not sufficient to observe an appreciable number of folding events, unless very simplified protein models are used. Here we present an approach that allows for the reconstruction of the full ensemble of folding pathways from simulations that are much shorter than the folding time. This approach can be applied to all-atom protein simulations in explicit solvent. It does not use a predefined reaction coordinate but is based on partitioning the state space into small conformational states and constructing a Markov model between them. A theory is presented that allows for the extraction of the full ensemble of transition pathways from the unfolded to the folded configurations. The approach is applied to the folding of a PinWW domain in explicit solvent where the folding time is two orders of magnitude larger than the length of individual simulations. The results are in good agreement with kinetic experimental data and give detailed insights about the nature of the folding process which is shown to be surprisingly complex and parallel. The analysis reveals the existence of misfolded trap states outside the network of efficient folding intermediates that significantly reduce the folding speed.},

abstract = {The problem of estimating a Markov transition matrix to statistically describe the dynamics underlying an observed process is frequently found in the physical and economical sciences. However, little attention has been paid to the fact that such an estimation is associated with statistical uncertainty, which depends on the number of observed transitions between metastable states. In turn, this induces uncertainties in any property computed from the transition matrix, such as stationary probabilities, committor probabilities, or eigenvalues. Assessing these uncertainties is essential for testing the reliability of a given observation and also, if possible, to plan further simulations or measurements in such a way that the most serious uncertainties will be reduced with minimal effort. Here, a rigorous statistical method is proposed to approximate the complete statistical distribution of functions of the transition matrix provided that one can identify discrete states such that the transition process between them may be modeled with a memoryless jump process, i.e., Markov dynamics. The method is based on sampling the statistical distribution of Markov transition matrices that is induced by the observed transition events. It allows the constraint of reversibility to be included, which is physically meaningful in many applications. The method is illustrated on molecular dynamics simulations of a hexapeptide that are modeled by a Markov transition process between the metastable states. For this model the distributions and uncertainties of the stationary probabilities of metastable states, the transition matrix elements, the committor probabilities, and the transition matrix eigenvalues are estimated. It is found that the detailed balance constraint can significantly alter the distribution of some observables.},

Structural differences between ATP- and ADP-G-actin are examined here using multiple molecular dynamics simulations. The  open and  closedconformational states of G-actin in aqueous solution are characterized, with either ATP or ADP in the nucleotide binding pocket. With both ATP and ADP bound, the open state closes in the absence of actin-bound profilin. The position of the nucleotide in the protein is found to be correlated with the degree of opening of the active site cleft. Further, the simulations reveal the existence of a structurally well-defined, compact,  superclosed state of ATP-G-actin, as yet unseen crystallographically and absent in the ADP-G-actin simulations. The superclosed state resembles structurally the actin monomer in filament models derived from fiber diffraction and is putatively the polymerization competent conformation of ATP-G-actin.},

abstract = {The identification of metastable states of a molecule plays an important role in the interpretation of molecular simulation data because the free-energy surface, the relative populations in this landscape, and ultimately also the dynamics of the molecule under study can be described in terms of these states. We compare the results of three different geometric cluster algorithms (neighbor algorithm, K-medoids algorithm, and common-nearest-neighbor algorithm) among each other and to the results of a kinetic cluster algorithm. First, we demonstrate the characteristics of each of the geometric cluster algorithms using five two-dimensional data sets. Second, we analyze the molecular dynamics data of a beta-heptapeptide in methanol--a molecule that exhibits a distinct folded state, a structurally diverse unfolded state, and a fast folding/unfolding equilibrium--using both geometric and kinetic cluster algorithms. We find that geometric clustering strongly depends on the algorithm used and that the density based common-nearest-neighbor algorithm is the most robust of the three geometric cluster algorithms with respect to variations in the input parameters and the distance metric. When comparing the geometric cluster results to the metastable states of the beta-heptapeptide as identified by kinetic clustering, we find that in most cases the folded state is identified correctly but the overlap of geometric clusters with further metastable states is often at best approximate.},

abstract = {Characterization of transient intermediate or transition states is crucial for the description of biomolecular folding pathways, which is, however, difficult in both experiments and computer simulations. Such transient states are typically of low population in simulation samples. Even for simple systems such as RNA hairpins, recently there are mounting debates over the existence of multiple intermediate states. In this paper, we develop a computational approach to explore the relatively low populated transition or intermediate states in biomolecular folding pathways, based on a topological data analysis tool, MAPPER, with simulation data from large-scale distributed computing. The method is inspired by the classical Morse theory in mathematics which characterizes the topology of high-dimensional shapes via some functional level sets. In this paper we exploit a conditional density filter which enables us to focus on the structures on pathways, followed by clustering analysis on its level sets, which helps separate low populated intermediates from high populated folded/unfolded structures. A successful application of this method is given on a motivating example, a RNA hairpin with GCAA tetraloop, where we are able to provide structural evidence from computer simulations on the multiple intermediate states and exhibit different pictures about unfolding and refolding pathways. The method is effective in dealing with high degree of heterogeneity in distribution, capturing structural features in multiple pathways, and being less sensitive to the distance metric than nonlinear dimensionality reduction or geometric embedding methods. The methodology described in this paper admits various implementations or extensions to incorporate more information and adapt to different settings, which thus provides a systematic tool to explore the low-density intermediate states in complex biomolecular folding systems.},

abstract = {We derive simple analytical expressions for the error and computational efficiency of replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations (and by analogy replica exchange Monte Carlo simulations). The theory applies to the important case of systems whose dynamics at long times is dominated by the slow interconversion between two metastable states. As a specific example, we consider the folding and unfolding of a protein. The efficiency is defined as the rate with which the error in an estimated equilibrium property, as measured by the variance of the estimator over repeated simulations, decreases with simulation time. For two-state systems, this rate is in general independent of the particular property. Our main result is that, with comparable computational resources used, the relative efficiency of REMD and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is given by the ratio of the number of transitions between the two states averaged over all replicas at the different temperatures, and the number of transitions at the single temperature of the MD run. This formula applies if replica exchange is frequent, as compared to the transition times. High efficiency of REMD is thus achieved by including replica temperatures in which the frequency of transitions is higher than that at the temperature of interest. In tests of the expressions for the error in the estimator, computational efficiency, and the rate of equilibration we find quantitative agreement with the results both from kinetic models of REMD and from actual all-atom simulations of the folding of a peptide in water.},

abstract = {Diffusion processes are relevant for a variety of phenomena in the natural sciences, including diffusion of cells or biomolecules within cells, diffusion of molecules on a membrane or surface, and diffusion of a molecular conformation within a complex energy landscape. Many experimental tools exist now to track such diffusive motions in single cells or molecules, including high-resolution light microscopy, optical tweezers, fluorescence quenching, and F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Experimental observations are most often indirect and incomplete: (1) They do not directly reveal the potential or diffusion constants that govern the diffusion process, (2) they have limited time and space resolution, and (3) the highest-resolution experiments do not track the motion directly but rather probe it stochastically by recording single events, such as photons, whose properties depend on the state of the system under investigation. Here, we propose a general Bayesian framework to model diffusion processes with nonlinear drift based on incomplete observations as generated by various types of experiments. A maximum penalized likelihood estimator is given as well as a Gibbs sampling method that allows to estimate the trajectories that have caused the measurement, the nonlinear drift or potential function and the noise or diffusion matrices, as well as uncertainty estimates of these properties. The approach is illustrated on numerical simulations of FRET experiments where it is shown that trajectories, potentials, and diffusion constants can be efficiently and reliably estimated even in cases with little statistics or nonequilibrium measurement conditions.},

The bounds are explicitly computable, sharp, and do not rely on any asymptotic expansions in terms of some smallness parameter, but rather hold for arbitrary transfer operators satisfying a reasonable spectral condition.},

abstract = {Computer simulations can complement experiments by providing insight into molecular kinetics with atomic resolution. Unfortunately, even the most powerful supercomputers can only simulate small systems for short time scales, leaving modeling of most biologically relevant systems and time scales intractable. In this work, however, we show that molecular simulations driven by adaptive sampling of networks called Markov State Models (MSMs) can yield tremendous time and resource savings, allowing previously intractable calculations to be performed on a routine basis on existing hardware. We also introduce a distance metric (based on the relative entropy) for comparing MSMs. We primarily employ this metric to judge the convergence of various sampling schemes but it could also be employed to assess the effects of perturbations to a system (e.g., determining how changing the temperature or making a mutation changes a system's dynamics).},

The intermediate has the N-terminal helix and a part of the C-terminal helix unfolded. In earlier studies, we also solved the structures of two other folding intermediates for the same protein: one with the N-terminal helix alone unfolded and the other with a reorganized hydrophobic core. Together, these structures provide a description of a protein folding pathway with multiple intermediates at atomic resolution. The two general features for the intermediates are (i) native-like backbone topology and (ii) nonnative side-chain interactions. These results have implications for important issues in protein folding studies, including large-scale conformation search, -value analysis, and computer simulations.},

Experimental evidence is presented for more than one such pathway in the folding dynamics of a globular protein, cytochrome c, After photodissociation of CO from the partially denatured ferrous protein, fast time-resolved CD spectroscopy shows a submillisecond folding process that is complete in approximate to 10(-6) s, concomitant with heme binding of a methionine residue. Kinetic modeling of time-resolved magnetic circular dichroism data further provides strong evidence that a 50-mu s heme-histidine binding process proceeds in parallel with the faster pathway, implying that Met and His binding occur in different conformational ensembles of the protein, i.e., along respective ultrafast (microseconds) and fast (milliseconds) folding pathways. This kinetic heterogeneity appears to be intrinsic to the diffusional nature of early folding dynamics on the energy landscape, as opposed to the tate-time heterogeneity associated with nonnative heme Ligation and proline isomers in cytochrome c.},

We show that, in general, these models exhibit a first-order dynamical transition between active and inactive dynamical phases. We argue that the dynamical heterogeneities displayed by these systems are a manifestation of dynamical first-order phase coexistence. In particular, we calculate dynamical large deviation functions, both analytically and numerically, for the Fredrickson-Andersen model, the East model, and constrained lattice gas models. We also show how large deviation functions can be obtained from a Landau-like theory for dynamical fluctuations. We discuss possibilities for similar dynamical phase-coexistence behaviour in other systems with heterogeneous dynamics.},

abstract = {Analysing stationary point databases to extract phenomenological rate constants can become time-consuming for systems with large potential energy barriers. In the present contribution we analyse several different approaches to this problem. First, we show how the original rate constant prescription within the discrete path sampling approach can be rewritten in terms of committor probabilities. Two alternative formulations are then derived in which the steady-state assumption for intervening minima is removed, providing both a more accurate kinetic analysis, and a measure of whether a two-state description is appropriate. The first approach involves running additional short kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) trajectories, which are used to calculate waiting times. Here we introduce 'leapfrog' moves to second-neighbour minima, which prevent the KMC trajectory oscillating between structures separated by low barriers. In the second approach we successively remove minima from the intervening set, renormalizing the branching probabilities and waiting times to preserve the mean first-passage times of interest. Regrouping the local minima appropriately is also shown to speed up the kinetic analysis dramatically at low temperatures. Applications are described where rates are extracted for databases containing tens of thousands of stationary points, with effective barriers that are several hundred times kBT.},

abstract = {Though urea is commonly used to denature proteins, the molecular mechanism of its denaturing ability is still a subject of considerable debate. Previous molecular dynamics simulation studies have sought to elucidate the mechanism of urea denaturation by focusing on the pathway of denaturation rather than examining the effect of urea on the folding/unfolding equilibrium, which is commonly measured in experiment Here we report the reversible folding/unfolding equilibrium of Trp-cage miniprotein in the presence of urea, over a broad range of urea concentrations, using all-atom Replica exchange MD simulations The simulations capture the experimentally observed linear dependence of unfolding free energy on urea concentration We find that the denaturation is driven by favorable direct interaction of urea with the protein through both electrostatic and van der Waals forces and quantify their contribution. Though the magnitude of direct electrostatic interaction of urea is larger than van der Waals, the difference between unfolded and folded ensembles is dominated by the van der Waals interaction We also find that hydrogen bonding of urea to the peptide backbone does not play a dominant role in denaturation The unfolded ensemble sampled depends on urea concentration, with greater urea concentration favoring conformations with greater solvent exposure The m-value is predicted to increase with temperature and more strongly so with pressure.},

abstract = {Markov jump processes can be used to model the effective dynamics of observables in applications ranging from molecular dynamics to finance. In this paper we present a different method which allows the inverse modeling of Markov jump processes based on incomplete observations in time: We consider the case of a given time series of the discretely observed jump process. We show how to compute efficiently the maximum likelihood estimator of its infinitesimal generator and demonstrate in detail that the method allows us to handle observations nonequidistant in time. The method is based on the work of and Bladt and S{\o}rensen [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B (Stat. Methodol.) 67, 395 (2005)] but scales much more favorably than it with the length of the time series and the dimension and size of the state space of the jump process. We illustrate its performance on a toy problem as well as on data arising from simulations of biochemical kinetics of a genetic toggle switch.},

Here we sketch our current perspective of Markov models and explain in short their theoretical basis and assumptions. We describe transition path theory which allows the entire ensemble of protein folding pathways to be investigated and that combines naturally with Markov models. Experimental observations can be naturally linked to Markov models with the dynamical fingerprint theory, by which experimentally observable timescales can be equipped with an understanding of the structural rearrangement processes that take place at these timescales. The concepts of this paper are illustrated by a simple kinetic model of protein folding.},

abstract = {Parallel tempering (PT) molecular dynamics simulations have been extensively investigated as a means of efficient sampling of the configurations of biomolecular systems. Recent work has demonstrated how the short physical trajectories generated in PT simulations of biomolecules can be used to construct the Markov models describing biomolecular dynamics at each simulated temperature. While this approach describes the temperature-dependent kinetics, it does not make optimal use of all available PT data, instead estimating the rates at a given temperature using only data from that temperature. This can be problematic, as some relevant transitions or states may not be sufficiently sampled at the temperature of interest, but might be readily sampled at nearby temperatures. Further, the comparison of temperature-dependent properties can suffer from the false assumption that data collected from different temperatures are uncorrelated. We propose here a strategy in which, by a simple modification of the PT protocol, the harvested trajectories can be reweighted, permitting data from all temperatures to contribute to the estimated kinetic model. The method reduces the statistical uncertainty in the kinetic model relative to the single temperature approach and provides estimates of transition probabilities even for transitions not observed at the temperature of interest. Further, the method allows the kinetics to be estimated at temperatures other than those at which simulations were run. We illustrate this method by applying it to the generation of a Markov model of the conformational dynamics of the solvated terminally blocked alanine peptide.},

abstract = {Dynamical averages based on functionals of dynamical trajectories, such as time-correlation functions, play an important role in determining kinetic or transport properties of matter. At temperatures of interest, the expectations of these quantities are often dominated by contributions from rare events, making the precise calculation of these quantities by molecular dynamics simulation difficult. Here, we present a reweighting method for combining simulations from multiple temperatures (or from simulated or parallel tempering simulations) to compute an optimal estimate of the dynamical properties at the temperature of interest without the need to invoke an approximate kinetic model (such as the Arrhenius law). Continuous and differentiable estimates of these expectations at any temperature in the sampled range can also be computed, along with an assessment of the associated statistical uncertainty. For rare events, aggregating data from multiple temperatures can produce an estimate with the desired precision at greatly reduced computational cost compared with simulations conducted at a single temperature. Here, we describe use of the method for the canonical (NVT) ensemble using four common models of dynamics (canonical distribution of Hamiltonian trajectories, Andersen thermostatting, Langevin, and overdamped Langevin or Brownian dynamics), but it can be applied to any thermodynamic ensemble provided the ratio of path probabilities at different temperatures can be computed. To illustrate the method, we compute a time-correlation function for solvated terminally-blocked alanine peptide across a range of temperatures using trajectories harvested using a modified parallel tempering protocol.},

abstract = {Markov state models of molecular kinetics (MSMs), in which the long-time statistical dynamics of a molecule is approximated by a Markov chain on a discrete partition of configuration space, have seen widespread use in recent years. This approach has many appealing characteristics compared to straightforward molecular dynamics simulation and analysis, including the potential to mitigate the sampling problem by extracting long-time kinetic information from short trajectories and the ability to straightforwardly calculate expectation values and statistical uncertainties of various stationary and dynamical molecular observables. In this paper, we summarize the current state of the art in generation and validation of MSMs and give some important new results. We describe an upper bound for the approximation error made by modeling molecular dynamics with a MSM and we show that this error can be made arbitrarily small with surprisingly little effort. In contrast to previous practice, it becomes clear that the best MSM is not obtained by the most metastable discretization, but the MSM can be much improved if non-metastable states are introduced near the transition states. Moreover, we show that it is not necessary to resolve all slow processes by the state space partitioning, but individual dynamical processes of interest can be resolved separately. We also present an efficient estimator for reversible transition matrices and a robust test to validate that a MSM reproduces the kinetics of the molecular dynamics data.},

abstract = {Protein-ligand interactions are essential for nearly all biological processes, and yet the biophysical mechanism that enables potential binding partners to associate before specific binding occurs remains poorly understood. Fundamental questions include which factors influence the formation of protein-ligand encounter complexes, and whether designated association pathways exist. To address these questions, we developed a computational approach to systematically analyze the complete ensemble of association pathways. Here, we use this approach to study the binding of a phosphate ion to the Escherichia coli phosphate-binding protein. Various mutants of the protein are considered, and their effects on binding free-energy profiles, association rates, and association pathway distributions are quantified. The results reveal the existence of two anion attractors, i.e., regions that initially attract negatively charged particles and allow them to be efficiently screened for phosphate, which is subsequently specifically bound. Point mutations that affect the charge on these attractors modulate their attraction strength and speed up association to a factor of 10 of the diffusion limit, and thus change the association pathways of the phosphate ligand. It is demonstrated that a phosphate that prebinds to such an attractor neutralizes its attraction effect to the environment, making the simultaneous association of a second phosphate ion unlikely. This study suggests ways in which structural properties can be used to tune molecular association kinetics so as to optimize the efficiency of binding, and highlights the importance of kinetic properties.},

abstract = {Functionally relevant slow conformational motions of proteins are, at present, in most cases inaccessible to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The main reason is that the major part of the computational effort is spend for the accurate description of a huge number of high frequency motions of the protein and the surrounding solvent. The accumulated influence of these fluctuations is crucial for a correct treatment of the conformational dynamics; however, their details can be considered irrelevant for most purposes. To accurately describe long time protein dynamics we here propose a reduced dimension approach, collective Langevin dynamics (CLD), which evolves the dynamics of the system within a small subspace of relevant collective degrees of freedom. The dynamics within the low-dimensional conformational subspace is evolved via a generalized Langevin equation which accounts for memory effects via memory kernels also extracted from short explicit MD simulations. To determine the memory kernel with differing levels of regularization, we propose and evaluate two methods. As a first test, CLD is applied to describe the conformational motion of the peptide neurotensin. A drastic dimension reduction is achieved by considering one single curved conformational coordinate. CLD yielded accurate thermodynamical and dynamical behaviors. In particular, the rate of transitions between two conformational states agreed well with a rate obtained from a 150 ns reference molecular dynamics simulation, despite the fact that the time scale of the transition (approximately 50 ns) was much longer than the 1 ns molecular dynamics simulation from which the memory kernel was extracted.},

abstract = {A systematic computational approach to describe the conformational dynamics of biomolecules in reduced dimensionality is presented. The method is based on (i) the decomposition of a high-dimensional molecular dynamics trajectory into a few "system" and (many) "bath" degrees of freedom and (ii) a Langevin simulation of the resulting model. Employing principal component analysis, the dimension of the system is chosen such that it contains all slow large-amplitude motions of the molecule, while the bath coordinates only account for its high-frequency fluctuations. It is shown that a sufficiently large dimension of the model is essential to ensure a clear time scale separation of system and bath variables, which warrants the validity of the memory-free Langevin equation. Applying methods from nonlinear time series analysis, a practical Langevin algorithm is presented which performs a local estimation of the multidimensional Langevin vector fields describing deterministic drift and stochastic driving. Adopting a 800 ns molecular dynamics simulation of the folding of heptaalanine in explicit water, it is shown that a five-dimensional Langevin model correctly reproduces the structure and conformational dynamics of the system. The virtues and limits of the approach are discussed in some detail.},

The drift- and the position-dependent diffusion profiles governing the Langevin dynamics are expressed as explicit averages over the input trajectories. The proposed strategy is applicable to cases when the input trajectories are generated by subjecting the system to an external time-dependent force (as opposed to canonically equilibrated trajectories). Second, it provides an explicit control on the statistical uncertainty in the drift and diffusion profiles. These features lend to the possibility of designing the external force driving the system to maximize the accuracy of the drift and diffusion profiles throughout the phase space of interest. Quantitative criteria are also provided to assess a posteriori the satisfiability of the requisites for applying the method, namely, the Markovian character of the stochastic dynamics of the collective variables.},

Due to the nondifferentiability (in the common sense) of multiple roots, directional derivatives of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in parametric space are obtained. Sensitivity analysis is based on the perturbation method of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The generalized eigenvalue problem and vibrational systems are also investigated. Strong and weak interaction of eigenvalues are distinguished and interactions in two- and three-dimensional space are treated geometrically. It is shown that the strong interaction of eigenvalues is a typical catastrophe. Simple examples that illustrate the main ideas are presented. The results obtained are important for qualitative and quantitative study of mechanical systems subjected to static and dynamic instability phenomena.},

abstract = {Theory, algorithms and LAPACK-style software for computing a pair of deflating subspaces with specified eigenvalues of a regular matrix pair (A, B) and error bounds for computed quantities (eigenvalues and eigenspaces) are presented. The reordering of specified eigenvalues is performed with a direct orthogonal transformation method with guaranteed numerical stability. Each swap of two adjacent diagonal blocks in the real generalized Schur form, where at least one of them corresponds to a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues, involves solving a generalized Sylvester equation and the construction of two orthogonal transformation matrices from certain eigenspaces associated with the diagonal blocks. The swapping of two 1 x 1 blocks is performed using orthogonal (unitary) Givens rotations. The error bound's are based on estimates of condition numbers for eigenvalues and eigenspaces. The software computes reciprocal values of a condition number for an individual eigenvalue (or a cluster of eigenvalues), a condition number for an eigenvector (or eigenspace), and spectral projectors onto a selected cluster. By computing reciprocal values we avoid overflow. Changes in eigenvectors and eigenspaces are measured by their change in angle. The condition numbers yield both asymptotic and global error bounds. The asymptotic bounds are only accurate for small perturbations (E, F) of (A, B), while the global bounds work for all \\(E, F)\\ up to a certain bound, whose size is determined by the conditioning of the problem. It is also shown how these upper bounds can be estimated. Fortran 77 software that implements our algorithms for reordering eigenvalues, computing (left and right) deflating subspaces with specified eigenvalues and condition number estimation are presented. Computational experiments that illustrate the accuracy, efficiency and reliability of our software are also described.},

Whereas experiments typically reveal only a few readily discernible exponential relaxations, simulations often indicate complex multistate behavior. Here, a theoretical framework is presented that reconciles these two approaches. The central concept is "dynamical fingerprints" which contain peaks at the time scales of the dynamical processes involved with amplitudes determined by the experimental observable. Fingerprints can be generated from both experimental and simulation data, and their comparison by matching peaks permits assignment of structural changes present in the simulation to experimentally observed relaxation processes. The approach is applied here to a test case interpreting single molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments on a set of fluorescent peptides with molecular dynamics simulations. The peptides exhibit complex kinetics shown to be consistent with the apparent simplicity of the experimental data. Moreover, the fingerprint approach can be used to design new experiments with site-specific labels that optimally probe specific dynamical processes in the molecule under investigation.},

abstract = {HIV maturation requires multiple cleavage of long polyprotein chains into functional proteins that include the viral protease itself. Initial cleavage by the protease dimer occurs from within these precursors, and yet only a single protease monomer is embedded in each polyprotein chain. Self-activation has been proposed to start from a partially dimerized protease formed from monomers of different chains binding its own N termini by self-association to the active site, but a complete structural understanding of this critical step in HIV maturation is missing. Here, we captured the critical self-association of immature HIV-1 protease to its extended amino-terminal recognition motif using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, thus confirming the postulated intramolecular mechanism in atomic detail. We show that self-association to a catalytically viable state requires structural cooperativity of the flexible $\beta$-hairpin "flap" regions of the enzyme and that the major transition pathway is first via self-association in the semiopen/open enzyme states, followed by enzyme conformational transition into a catalytically viable closed state. Furthermore, partial N-terminal threading can play a role in self-association, whereas wide opening of the flaps in concert with self-association is not observed. We estimate the association rate constant (k(on)) to be on the order of ∼1 × 10(4) s(-1), suggesting that N-terminal self-association is not the rate-limiting step in the process. The shown mechanism also provides an interesting example of molecular conformational transitions along the association pathway.},

abstract = {When studying a metastable dynamical system, a prime con- cern is how to decompose the state space into a set of metastable states. However, the metastable state decomposition based on simulation or experimental data is still a challenge. The most popular and simplest approach is geometric clustering, which was developed based on the clas- sical clustering technique but only works for simple diffusion processes. Recently, the kinetic clustering approach based on state space discretiza- tion and transition probability estimation has attracted many attentions for it is applicable to more general systems, but the choice of discretiza- tion policy is a difficult task. In this paper, a new decomposition method, called maximum margin metastable clustering, is proposed, which con- verts the problem of metastable state decomposition into a unsupervised learning problem use the large margin technique to search for the opti- mal decomposition without state space discretization. Some simulation examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

A common experiment is to measure the force dependence of conformational changes at equilibrium. Here, we demonstrate that the commonly used technique of force feedback has severe limitations when used to evaluate rapid macromolecular conformational transitions. By comparing the force-dependent dynamics of three major classes of macromolecules (DNA, RNA, and protein) using both a constant-force-feedback and a constant-trap-position technique, we demonstrate a problem in force-feedback experiments. The finite response time of the instrument's force feedback can modify the behavior of the molecule, leading to errors in the reported parameters, such as the rate constants and the distance to the transition state, for the conformational transitions. We elucidate the causes of this problem and provide a simple test to identify and evaluate the magnitude of the effect. We recommend avoiding the use of constant force feedback as a method to study rapid conformational changes in macromolecules.},

Markov state models (MSM) are designed to represent the effective dynamics of such a process by a Markov chain that jumps between the metastable sets with the transition rates of the original process. MSM are used for a number of applications, including molecular dynamics (cf. Noe et al, PNAS(106) 2009)[1], since more than a decade. The rigorous and fully general (no zero temperature limit or comparable restrictions) analysis of their approximation quality, however, has only been started recently. Our first article on this topics (Sarich et al, MMS(8) 2010)[2] introduces an error bound for the difference in propagation of probability densities between the MSM and the original process on long time scales. Herein we provide upper bounds for the error in the eigenvalues between the MSM and the original process which means that we analyse how well the longest timescales in the original process are approximated by the MSM. Our findings are illustrated by numerical experiments.},

abstract = {Neutron scattering experiments directly probe the dynamics of complex molecules on the sub pico- to microsecond time scales. However, the assignment of the relaxations seen experimentally to specific structural rearrangements is difficult, since many of the underlying dynamical processes may exist on similar timescales. In an accompanying article we present a theoretical approach to the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations with a Markov State Model (MSM) that permits the direct identification of structural transitions leading to each contributing relaxation process. Here, we demonstrate the use of the method by applying it to the configurational dynamics of the well-characterized alanine dipeptide. A practical procedure for deriving the MSM from an MD is introduced. The result is a 9-state MSM in the space of the backbone dihedral angles and the side- chain methyl group. The agreement between the quasielastic spectrum calculated directly from the atomic trajectories and that derived from the Markov state model is excellent. The dependence on the wavevector of the individual Markov processes is described. The procedure means that it is now practicable to interpret quasielastic scattering spectra in terms of well-defined intramolecular transitions with minimal a priori assumptions as to the nature of the dynamics taking place.},

abstract = {The dynamics of complex molecules can be directly probed by inelastic neutron scattering experiments. However, many of the underlying dynamical processes may exist on similar timescales, which makes it difficult to assign processes seen experimentally to specific structural rearrangements. Here, we show how Markov models and can be used to connect structural changes observed in molecular dynamics simulation directly to the relaxation processes probed by scattering experiments. For this, a conformational dynamics theory of dynamical neutron and X-ray scattering is de- veloped, following our previous approach for computing dynamical fingerprints of time-correlation functions [1]. Markov modeling is used to approximate the relaxation processes and timescales of the molecule via the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a transition matrix between conformational substates. This procedure allows the establishment of a complete set of exponential decay functions and a full decomposition into the individual contributions, i.e., the contribution of every atom and dynamical process to each experimental relaxation process.},

abstract = {Many interesting dynamic properties of biological molecules cannot be simulated directly using molecular dynamics because of nanosecond time scale limitations. These systems are trapped in potential energy minima with high free energy barriers for large numbers of computational steps. The dynamic evolution of many molecular systems occurs through a series of rare events as the system moves from one potential energy basin to another. Therefore, we have proposed a robust bias potential function that can be used in an efficient accelerated molecular dynamics approach to simulate the transition of high energy barriers without any advance knowledge of the location of either the potential energy wells or saddle points. In this method, the potential energy landscape is altered by adding a bias potential to the true potential such that the escape rates from potential wells are enhanced, which accelerates and extends the time scale in molecular dynamics simulations. Our definition of the bias potential echoes the underlying shape of the potential energy landscape on the modified surface, thus allowing for the potential energy minima to be well defined, and hence properly sampled during the simulation. We have shown that our approach, which can be extended to biomolecules, samples the conformational space more efficiently than normal molecular dynamics simulations, and converges to the correct canonical distribution.},

abstract = {A numerical scheme for solving high-dimensional stochastic control problems on an infinite time horizon that appear relevant in the context of molecular dynamics is outlined. The scheme rests on the interpretation of the corresponding Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem that, using a logarithmic transformation, can be recast as a linear eigenvalue problem, for which the principal eigenvalue and its eigenfunction are sought. The latter can be computed efficiently by approximating the underlying stochastic process with a coarse-grained Markov state model for the dominant metastable sets. We illustrate our method with two numerical examples, one of which involves the task of maximizing the population of $\alpha$-helices in an ensemble of small biomolecules (alanine dipeptide), and discuss the relation to the large deviation principle of Donsker and Varadhan.},

abstract = {In the companion article, a framework for structural multiscale geometric organization of subsets of R^n and of graphs was introduced. Here, diffusion semigroups are used to generate multiscale analyses in order to organize and represent complex structures. We emphasize the multiscale nature of these problems and build scaling functions of Markov matrices (describing local transitions) that lead to macroscopic descriptions at different scales. The process of iterating or diffusing the Markov matrix is seen as a generalization of some aspects of the Newtonian paradigm, in which local infinitesimal transitions of a system lead to global macroscopic descriptions by integration. This article deals with the construction of fast-order N algorithms for data representation and for homogenization of heterogeneous structures.},

abstract = {Recently, a novel concept for the computation of essential features of Hamiltonian systems (such as those arising in molecular dynamics) has been proposed. The realization of that concept was based on subdivision techniques applied to the Frobenius-Perron operator for the dynamical system. The present paper suggests an alternative but related concept based on statistical mechanics, which allows to attack realistic molecular systems. In a first step, the frequency of conformational changes is characterized in statistical terms leading to the definition of some Markov operator that describes the corresponding transition probabilities within the canonical ensemble. In a second step, a discretization of via hybrid Monte Carlo techniques (based on short term subtrajectories only) is shown to lead to a stochastic matrix . With these theoretical preparations, an identification algorithm for conformations is applicable (to be presented elsewhere). Numerical results for the n-pentane molecule are given and interpreted.},

abstract = {The equilibrium kinetics of biomolecules can be probed by techniques such as temperature-jump or fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. These measurements can be described by dynamical fingerprints, i.e., densities of relaxation timescales where each peak corresponds to an exponential relaxation process. In many cases, single- or double-peaked fingerprints are found, suggesting that a two- or three-state model may provide a satisfactory description of the biomolecule studied, while simulations often reveal a more complex picture with many kinetically relevant states. Here we sketch an approach combining Markov models of the simulated dynamics with dynamical fingerprints to link between simulation and experiment. This link sheds light on the relation between experimental setup and sensitivity of the experiment to particular kinetic processes. Furthermore, our approach can be used to design experiments such that specific processes appear with large amplitudes.This is illustrated by reviewing recent results from the analysis of the fluorescent 18-mer peptide MR121-(GS)9-W.},

abstract = {While seemingly straightforward in principle, the reliable estimation of rate constants is seldom easy in practice. Numerous issues, such as the complication of poor reaction coordinates, cause obvious approaches to yield unreliable estimates. When a reliable order parameter is available, the reactive flux theory of Chandler allows the rate constant to be extracted from the plateau region of an appropriate reactive flux function. However, when applied to real data from single-molecule experiments or molecular dynamics simulations, the rate can sometimes be difficult to extract due to the numerical differentiation of a noisy empirical correlation function or difficulty in locating the plateau region at low sampling frequencies. We present a modified version of this theory which does not require numerical derivatives, allowing rate constants to be robustly estimated from the time-correlation function directly. We compare these approaches using single-molecule force spectroscopy measurements of an RNA hairpin.},

abstract = {Proteins have evolved to fold and function within a cellular environment that is characterized by high macromolecular content. The earliest step of protein folding represents intrachain contact formation of amino acid residues within an unfolded polypeptide chain. It has been proposed that macromolecular crowding can have significant effects on rates and equilibria of biomolecular processes. However, the kinetic consequences on intrachain diffusion of polypeptides have not been tested experimentally, yet. Here, we demonstrate that selective fluorescence quenching of the oxazine fluorophore MR121 by the amino acid tryptophan (Trp) in combination with fast fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) can be used to monitor end-to-end contact formation rates of unfolded polypeptide chains. MR121 and Trp were incorporated at the terminal ends of polypeptides consisting of repetitive units of glycine (G) and serine (S) residues. End-to-end contact formation and dissociation result in "off" and "on" switching of MR121 fluorescence and underlying kinetics can be revealed in FCS experiments with nanosecond time resolution. We revisit previous experimental studies concerning the dependence of end-to-end contact formation rates on polypeptide chain length, showing that kinetics can be described by Gaussian chain theory. We further investigate effects of solvent viscosity and temperature on contact formation rates demonstrating that intrachain diffusion represents a purely diffusive, entropy-controlled process. Finally, we study the influence of macromolecular crowding on polypeptide chain dynamics. The data presented demonstrate that intrachain diffusion is fast in spite of hindered diffusion caused by repulsive interactions with macromolecules. Findings can be explained by effects of excluded volume reducing chain entropy and therefore accelerating the loop search process. Our results suggest that within a cellular environment the early formation of structural elements in unfolded proteins can still proceed quite efficiently in spite of hindered diffusion caused by high macromolecular content.},

Further extensions are included to combine state-specific principal component analysis (PCA) and state-specific regressive trend models to handle the high-dimensional, nonstationary data. The identification of market phases allows one to control the involved phase-specific risk for futures portfolios. The numerical optimization strategy for futures portfolios based on Tikhonov-type regularization is presented. The application of proposed strategies to online detection of the market phases is exemplified first on the simulated data and then on historical futures prices for oil and wheat from 2005--2008. Numerical tests demonstrate the comparison of the presented methods with existing approaches.

In biomolecular systems, the principal component analysis is a well-known method for analyzing the static properties of fluctuations of structures obtained by a simulation and classifying the structures into some groups. On the other hand, the relaxation mode analysis has been used to analyze the dynamic properties of homopolymer systems. In this article, a long Monte Carlo simulation of Met-enkephalin in gas phase has been performed. The results are analyzed by the principal component analysis and relaxation mode analysis methods. We compare the results of both methods and show the effectiveness of the relaxation mode analysis.},

We provide a validation and performance evaluation of the code and run a microsecond-long trajectory for an all-atom molecular system in explicit TIP3P water on a single workstation computer equipped with just 3 GPUs.

abstract = {Force-extension (F-x) relationships were measured for single molecules of DNA under a variety of buffer conditions, using an optical trapping interferometer modified to incorporate feedback control. One end of a single DNA molecule was fixed to a coverglass surface by means of a stalled RNA polymerase complex. The other end was linked to a microscopic bead, which was captured and held in an optical trap. The DNA was subsequently stretched by moving the coverglass with respect to the trap using a piezo-driven stage, while the position of the bead was recorded at nanometer-scale resolution. An electronic feedback circuit was activated to prevent bead movement beyond a preset clamping point by modulating the light intensity, altering the trap stiffness dynamically. This arrangement permits rapid determination of the F-x relationship for individual DNA molecules as short as -1 micron with unprecedented accuracy, subjected to both low (approximately 0.1 pN) and high (approximately 50 pN) loads: complete data sets are acquired in under a minute. Experimental F-x relationships were fit over much of their range by entropic elasticity theories based on worm-like chain models. Fits yielded a persistence length, Lp, of approximately 47 nm in a buffer containing 10 mM Na1. Multivalent cations, such as Mg2+ or spermidine 3+, reduced Lp to approximately 40 nm. Although multivalent ions shield most of the negative charges on the DNA backbone, they did not further reduce Lp significantly, suggesting that the intrinsic persistence length remains close to 40 nm. An elasticity theory incorporating both enthalpic and entropic contributions to stiffness fit the experimental results extremely well throughout the full range of extensions and returned an elastic modulus of approximately 1100 pN.},

abstract = {This paper describes 96- and 384-microzone plates fabricated in paper as alternatives to conventional multiwell plates fabricated in molded polymers. Paper-based plates are functionally related to plastic well plates, but they offer new capabilities. For example, paper-microzone plates are thin (∼180 $\mu$m), require small volumes of sample (5 $\mu$L per zone), and can be manufactured from inexpensive materials ($0.05 per plate). The paper-based plates are fabricated by patterning sheets of paper, using photolithography, into hydrophilic zones surrounded by hydrophobic polymeric barriers.

abstract = {Music making (playing an instrument or singing) is a multimodal activity that involves the integration of auditory and sensorimotor processes. The ability to sing in humans is evident from infancy, and does not depend on formal vocal training but can be enhanced by training. Given the behavioral similarities between singing and speaking, as well as the shared and distinct neural correlates of both, researchers have begun to examine whether singing can be used to treat some of the speech-motor abnormalities associated with various neurological conditions. This paper reviews recent evidence on the therapeutic effects of singing, and how it can potentially ameliorate some of the speech deficits associated with conditions such as stuttering, Parkinson's disease, acquired brain lesions, and autism. By reviewing the status quo, it is hoped that future research can help to disentangle the relative contribution of factors to why singing works. This may ultimately lead to the development of specialized or ``gold-standard'' treatments for these disorders, and to an improvement in the quality of life for patients.},

abstract = {This study explored the possible beneficial effects of singing on well-being during a sing- ing lesson. Eight amateur (2m, 6f, age 28-53 yrs) and eight professional (4m, 4f, age 26- 49 yrs) singers who had been attending singing lessons for at least six months were included. Continuous ECG was recorded and computerized spectral analysis was per- formed. Serum concentrations of TNF-alpha, prolactin, cortisol, and oxytocin were mea- sured before and 30 min after the lesson. Five visual analogue scales (VAS, sad-joyful, anxious-calm, worried-elated, listless-energetic, and tense-relaxed) were scored before and after the lesson. In addition, a semi-structured interview was performed.
Heart rate variability analyses showed significant changes over time in the two groups for total power, and low and high frequency power. Power increased during singing in professionals, whereas there were no changes in amateurs. This indicates an ability to retain more "heart-brain connection," i.e., more cardio-physiologicalfitness for singing in professional singers, compared to amateur singers. Serum concentration of TNF-alpha increased in professionals after the singing lesson, whereas the concentration in amateurs decreased. Serum concentrations of prolactin and cortisol increased after the lesson in the group of men and vice versa for women. Oxytocin concentrations increased significantly in both groups after the singing lesson. Amateurs reported increasing joy and elatedness (VAS), whereas professionals did not. However, both groups felt more energetic and relaxed after the singing lesson. The interviews showed that the professionals were clearly achievement-oriented, with focus on singing technique, vocal apparatus and body during the lesson. The amateurs used the singing lessons as a means of self-actualizationand self- expression as a way to release emotional tensions. In summary, in this study, singing during a singing lesson seemed to promote more well-being and less arousal for amateurs compared to professional singers, who seemed to experience less well-being and more arousal.},

abstract = {Much of our enjoyment of music comes from its balance of predictability and surprise. Musical pitch fluctuations follow a 1/f power law that precisely achieves this balance. Musical rhythms, especially those of Western classical music, are considered highly regular and predictable, and this predictability has been hypothe- sized to underlie rhythm's contribution to our enjoyment of music. Are musical rhythms indeed entirely predictable and how do they vary with genre and composer? To answer this question, we ana- lyzed the rhythm spectra of 1,788 movements from 558 composi- tions of Western classical music. We found that an overwhelming majority of rhythms obeyed a 1/f $\beta$ power law across 16 subgenres and 40 composers, with $\beta$ ranging from ∼0.5--1. Notably, classical composers, whose compositions are known to exhibit nearly iden- tical 1/f pitch spectra, demonstrated distinctive 1/f rhythm spectra: Beethoven's rhythms were among the most predictable, and Mozart's among the least. Our finding of the ubiquity of 1/f rhythm spectra in compositions spanning nearly four centuries demonstrates that, as with musical pitch, musical rhythms also exhibit a balance of predictability and surprise that could contrib- ute in a fundamental way to our aesthetic experience of music. Although music compositions are intended to be performed, the fact that the notated rhythms follow a 1/f spectrum indicates that such structure is no mere artifact of performance or perception, but rather, exists within the written composition before the music is performed. Furthermore, composers systematically manipulate (consciously or otherwise) the predictability in 1/f rhythms to give their compositions unique identities.},

Examples are presented to illustrate how rate theories can be used to generate insight at the microscopic level into biomolecular behaviors. An attempt is made to clear up a number of misconceptions in the literature regarding popular rate theories, including the appearance of Planck's constant in the transition-state theory and the Smoluchowski result as an upper limit for protein-protein and protein-DNA association rate constants. Future work in combining the implementation of rate theories through computer simulations with experimental probes of rate processes, and in modeling effects of intracellular environments so that theories can be used for generating rate constants for systems biology studies is particularly exciting.},

abstract = {The nucleosome has a central role in the compaction of genomic DNA and the control of DNA accessibility for transcription and replication. To help understanding the mechanism of nucleosome opening and closing in these processes, we studied the disassembly of mononucleosomes by quantitative single-molecule FRET with high spatial resolution, using the SELEX-generated "Widom 601" positioning sequence labeled with donor and acceptor fluorophores. Reversible dissociation was induced by increasing NaCl concentration. At least 3 species with different FRET were identified and assigned to structures: (i) the most stable high-FRET species corresponding to the intact nucleosome, (ii) a less stable mid-FRET species that we attribute to a first intermediate with a partially unwrapped DNA and less histones, and (iii) a low-FRET species characterized by a very broad FRET distribution, representing highly unwrapped structures and free DNA formed at the expense of the other 2 species. Selective FCS analysis indicates that even in the low-FRET state, some histones are still bound to the DNA. The interdye distance of 54.0 A measured for the high-FRET species corresponds to a compact conformation close to the known crystallographic structure. The coexistence and interconversion of these species is first demonstrated under non-invasive conditions. A geometric model of the DNA unwinding predicts the presence of the observed FRET species. The different structures of these species in the disassembly pathway map the energy landscape indicating major barriers for 10-bp and minor ones for 5-bp DNA unwinding steps.},

abstract = {The comparison of F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiencies between two fluorophores covalently attached to a single protein or DNA molecule is an elegant approach for deducing information about their structural and dynamical heterogeneity. For a more detailed structural interpretation of single-molecule FRET assays, information about the positions as well as the dynamics of the dye labels attached to the biomolecule is important. In this work, Rhodamine 6G (2-[3'-(ethylamino)-6'-(ethylimino)-2',7'-dimethyl-6'H-xanthen-9'-yl]-benzoic acid) bound to the 5'-end of a 20 base pair long DNA duplex is investigated by both single-molecule multiparameter fluorescence detection (MFD) experiments and NMR spectroscopy. Rhodamine 6G is commonly employed in nucleic acid research as a FRET dye. MFD experiments directly reveal the equilibrium of the dye bound to DNA between three heterogeneous environments, which are characterized by distinct fluorescence lifetime and intensity distributions as a result of different guanine-dye excited-state electron transfer interactions. Sub-ensemble fluorescence autocorrelation analysis shows the highly dynamic character of the dye-DNA interactions ranging from nano- to milliseconds and species-specific triplet relaxation times. Two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy corroborates this information by the determination of the detailed geometric structures of the dye-nucleobase complex and their assignment to each population observed in the single-molecule fluorescence experiments. From both methods, a consistent and detailed molecular description of the structural and dynamical heterogeneity is obtained.},

abstract = {The remarkable fidelity of most DNA polymerases depends on a series of early steps in the reaction pathway which allow the selection of the correct nucleotide substrate, while excluding all incorrect ones, before the enzyme is committed to the chemical step of nucleotide incorporation. The conformational transitions that are involved in these early steps are detectable with a variety of fluorescence assays and include the fingers-closing transition that has been characterized in structural studies. Using DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) labeled with both donor and acceptor fluorophores, we have employed single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to study the polymerase conformational transitions that precede nucleotide addition. Our experiments clearly distinguish the open and closed conformations that predominate in Pol-DNA and Pol-DNA-dNTP complexes, respectively. By contrast, the unliganded polymerase shows a broad distribution of FRET values, indicating a high degree of conformational flexibility in the protein in the absence of its substrates; such flexibility was not anticipated on the basis of the available crystallographic structures. Real-time observation of conformational dynamics showed that most of the unliganded polymerase molecules sample the open and closed conformations in the millisecond timescale. Ternary complexes formed in the presence of mismatched dNTPs or complementary ribonucleotides show unique FRET species, which we suggest are relevant to kinetic checkpoints that discriminate against these incorrect substrates.},

To this end, we use deconvolution force spectroscopy to follow an individual molecule's trajectory with high temporal and spatial resolution. We find a heterogeneous energy landscape of the GCN4 leucine zipper domain. The energy profile is divided into two stable C-terminal heptad repeats and two less stable repeats at the N-terminus.

abstract = {Energy landscape theory is a powerful tool for understanding the structure and dynamics of complex molecular systems, in particular biological macromolecules. The primary sequence of a protein defines its free-energy landscape and thus determines the folding pathway and the rate constants of folding and unfolding, as well as the protein's native structure. Theory has shown that roughness in the energy landscape will lead to slower folding, but derivation of detailed experimental descriptions of this landscape is challenging. Simple folding models show that folding is significantly influenced by chain entropy; proteins in which the contacts are local fold quickly, owing to the low entropy cost of forming stabilizing, native contacts during folding. For some protein families, stability is also a determinant of folding rate constants. Where these simple metrics fail to predict folding behaviour, it is probable that there are features in the energy landscape that are unusual. Such general observations cannot explain the folding behaviour of the R15, R16 and R17 domains of alpha-spectrin. R15 folds approximately 3,000 times faster than its homologues, although they have similar structures, stabilities and, as far as can be determined, transition-state stabilities. Here we show that landscape roughness (internal friction) is responsible for the slower folding and unfolding of R16 and R17. We use chimaeric domains to demonstrate that this internal friction is a property of the core, and suggest that frustration in the landscape of the slow-folding spectrin domains may be due to misdocking of the long helices during folding. Theoretical studies have suggested that rugged landscapes will result in slower folding; here we show experimentally that such a phenomenon directly influences the folding kinetics of a 'normal' protein, that is, one with a significant energy barrier that folds on a relatively slow, millisecond-second, timescale.},

The classic Michaelis-Menten mechanism provides a highly satisfactory description of catalytic activities for large ensembles of enzyme molecules. Here we tested the Michaelis-Menten equation at the single-molecule level. We monitored long time traces of enzymatic turnovers for individual beta-galactosidase molecules by detecting one fluorescent product at a time. A molecular memory phenomenon arises at high substrate concentrations, characterized by clusters of turnover events separated by periods of low activity. Such memory lasts for decades of timescales ranging from milliseconds to seconds owing to the presence of interconverting conformers with broadly distributed lifetimes. We proved that the Michaelis-Menten equation still holds even for a fluctuating single enzyme, but bears a different microscopic interpretation.},

abstract = {Although the structures of native proteins are generally unique, the pathways by which they form are often free to vary. Some proteins fold by a multitude of different pathways, whereas others seem restricted to only one choice. An explanation for this variation in folding behaviour has recently emerged from studies of transition state changes: the number of accessible pathways is linked to the number of nucleation motifs contained within the native topology. We refer to these nucleation motifs as 'foldons', as they approach the size of an independent cooperative unit. Thus, with respect to pathway malleability and the composition of the folding funnel, proteins can be seen as modular assemblies of competing foldons. For the split beta-alpha-beta fold, these foldons are two-strand-helix motifs coupled by spatial overlap.},

abstract = {The slow folding of a single tryptophan-containing mutant of barstar has been studied in the presence of 2 M urea at 10 degrees C, using steady state and time-resolved fluorescence methods and far and near-UV CD measurements. The protein folds in two major phases: a fast phase, which is lost in the dead time of measurement during which the polypeptide collapses to a compact form, is followed by a slow observable phase. During the fast phase, the rotational correlation time of Trp53 increases from 2.2 ns to 7.2 ns, and its mean fluorescence lifetime increases from 2.3 ns to 3.4 ns. The fractional changes in steady-state fluorescence, far-UV CD, and near-UV CD signals, which are associated with the fast phase are, respectively, 36 %, 46 %, and 16 %. The product of the fast phase can bind the hydrophobic dye ANS. These observations together suggest that the folding intermediate accumulated at the end of the fast phase has: (a) about 20 % of the native-state secondary structure, (b) marginally formed or disordered tertiary structure, (c) a water-intruded and mobile protein interior; and (d) solvent-accessible patches of hydrophobic groups. Measurements of the anisotropy decay of Trp53 suggest that it undergoes two types of rotational motion in the intermediate: (i) fast (tau(r) approximately 1 ns) local motion of its indole side-chain, and (ii) a slower (tau(r) approximately 7.2 ns) motion corresponding to global tumbling of the entire protein molecule. The ability of the Trp53 side-chain to undergo fast local motion in the intermediate, but not in the fully folded protein where it is completely buried in the hydrophobic core, suggests that the core of the intermediate is still poorly packed. The global tumbling time of the fully folded protein is faster at 5.6 ns, suggesting that the volume of the intermediate is 25 % more than that of the fully folded protein. The rate of folding of this intermediate to the native state, measured by steady-state fluorescence, far-UV CD, and near-UV CD, is 0.07(+/-0.01) min(-1) This rate compares to a rate of folding of 0.03(+/-0.005) min(-1), determined by double-jump experiments which monitor directly formation of native protein; and to a rate of folding of 0.05 min(-1), when determined from time-resolved anisotropy measurements of the long rotational correlation time, which relaxes from an initial value of 7.2 ns to a final value of 5. 6 ns as the protein folds. On the other hand, the amplitude of the short correlation time decreases rapidly with a rate of 0.24(+/-0.06) min(-1). These results suggest that tight packing of residues in the hydrophobic core occurs relatively early during the observable slow folding reaction, before substantial secondary and tertiary structure formation and before final compaction of the protein.},

It organizes this large body of material to make it accessible for the first time to the many nonexpert users who need to choose the best state-of-the-art algorithms and software for their problems. Using an informal decision tree, just enough theory is introduced to identify the relevant mathematical structure that determines the best algorithm for each problem. The algorithms and software at the `leaves' of the decision tree range from the classical QR algorithm, which is most suitable for small dense matrices, to iterative algorithms for very large generalized eigenvalue problems. Algorithms are presented in a unified style as templates, with different levels of detail suitable for readers ranging from beginning students to experts.},

abstract = {Energy landscapes have been used to conceptually describe and model protein folding but have been difficult to measure experimentally, in large part because of the myriad of partly folded protein conformations that cannot be isolated and thermodynamically characterized. Here we experimentally determine a detailed energy landscape for protein folding. We generated a series of overlapping constructs containing subsets of the seven ankyrin repeats of the Drosophila Notch receptor, a protein domain whose linear arrangement of modular structural units can be fragmented without disrupting structure. To a good approximation, stabilities of each construct can be described as a sum of energy terms associated with each repeat. The magnitude of each energy term indicates that each repeat is intrinsically unstable but is strongly stabilized by interactions with its nearest neighbors. These linear energy terms define an equilibrium free energy landscape, which shows an early free energy barrier and suggests preferred low-energy routes for folding.},

During catalytic action of the enzyme cyclophilin A, we detect conformational fluctuations of the active site that occur on a time scale of hundreds of microseconds. The rates of conformational dynamics of the enzyme strongly correlate with the microscopic rates of substrate turnover. The present results, together with available structural data, allow a prediction of the reaction trajectory.},

We have monitored directly the kinetics of formation of the native molecule by the binding of a fluorescently labelled inhibitor, MeU-diNAG (4-methylumbelliferyl-N,N'-diacetyl-beta-D-chitobioside). The data show that native character monitored in this way also develops with different timescales. Although the rate determining step on the slow pathway (approximately 75% of molecules at pH 5.5, 20 degrees C) can be attributed to the need to reorganise structure formed early in the folding process, the data indicate that the rate determining step on the fast track (involving approximately 25% of molecules) involves the docking of the two constituent domains of the protein. In the fast folding track the data are consistent with a model in which each domain forms persistent structure prior to their docking in a locally cooperative manner on a timescale comparable to the folding of small single domain proteins.},

abstract = {Classical rate theories fail in cases where the observable(s) or order parameter(s) used are poor reaction coordinates or the observed signal is deteriorated by noise, such that no clear separation between reactants and products is possible. Here, we present a general rate theory for ergodic dynamical systems in thermal equilibrium that explicitly takes into account how the system is observed. The theory allows the systematic estimation errors made by standard rate theories to be understood and quantified. We also elucidate the connection of spectral rate theory with the popular Markov state modeling (MSM) approach for molecular simulation studies. An optimal rate estimator is formulated that gives robust and unbiased results even for poor reaction coordinates and can be applied to both computer simulations and single-molecule experiments. No definition of a dividing surface is required, and a measure of the reaction coordinate quality (RCQ) becomes readily available. Additionally, the respective partial probability distributions can be obtained for the reactant and product states along the observed order parameter, even when these strongly overlap. The approach is demonstrated on numerical examples and experimental single-molecule force probe data of the p5ab RNA hairpin and the apo-myoglobin at low pH protein, here focusing on the case of two-state kinetics.},

Under a longitudinal stress of approximately 65 piconewtons (pN), dsDNA molecules in aqueous buffer undergo a highly cooperative transition into a stable form with 5.8 angstroms rise per base pair, that is, 70% longer than B form dsDNA. When the stress was relaxed below 65 pN, the molecules rapidly and reversibly contracted to their normal contour lengths. This transition was affected by changes in the ionic strength of the medium and the water activity or by cross-linking of the two strands of dsDNA.

abstract = {From the first high-resolution structure of a repressor bound specifically to its DNA recognition sequence it has been shown that the phage 434 repressor protein binds as a dimer to the helix. Tight, local interactions are made at the ends of the binding site, causing the central four base pairs (bp) to become bent and overtwisted. The centre of the operator is not in contact with protein but repressor binding affinity can be reduced at least 50-fold in response to a sequence change there. This observation might be explained should the structure of the intervening DNA segment vary with its sequence, or if DNA at the centre of the operator resists the torsional and bending deformation necessary for complex formation in a sequence dependent fashion. We have considered the second hypothesis by demonstrating that DNA stiffness is sequence dependent. A method is formulated for calculating the stiffness of any particular DNA sequence, and we show that this predicted relationship between sequence and stiffness can explain the repressor binding data in a quantitative manner. We propose that the elastic properties of DNA may be of general importance to an understanding of protein-DNA binding specificity.},

'Will meinen: Nat{\"u}rlich kann man die 15 Originalkompositionen von Philipp Moehrke auch nur 'einfach so' spielen und wird dabei eine Menge Spa{\ss} haben.

Der Aufbau dieses Buches ist etwas ungew{\"o}hnlich. Anstatt alle Voicings in einem Kapitel und den ganzen Theoriekomplex in einem anderen Kapitel zu behandeln, wechseln sich die Themen im Verlauf dieses Buches ab. Einfachere Sachverhalte schreiten zu komplexeren Techniken fort. 
Musiktheoretische Fragen werden immer anhand von Transkriptionen und St{\"u}cken erl{\"a}utert, die von Jazzmusikern h{\"a}ufig gespielt werden. Die Auswahl reicht von Standards wie Just Friends bis zu Wayne Shorters ungew{\"o}hnlicher und wundersch{\"o}ner Ballade Infant Eyes. 
Obwohl sich Das Jazz Piano Buch in erster Linie an Pianisten wendet, erleichtern die visuellen Vorteile, die das Piano bietet, allen anderen Instrumentalisten und Vokalisten den Zugang zur Harmonik des Jazz. 
Es ist jedoch keine Lehnstuhllekt{\"u}re, sondern ein Buch, das zum {\"U}ben und Erforschen am Piano inspiriert. 
Aus dem Inhalt: Intervalle und Dreikl{\"a}nge ein {\"U}berblick; die Modi der Durskala und die II-V-I Verbindung; dreistimmige Voicings; sus und phrygische Akkorde; das Erweitern von dreistimmigen Voicings; Tritonussubstitution; Left-Hand Voicings; alterierte T{\"o}ne in Left-Hand Voicings; Skalentheorie; Skalen in der Praxis; So What-Akkorde; Quartenakkorde; Upper Structures; pentatonische Skalen; Voicings; Stride und Bud Powell Voicings; Viertonskalen; Blockakkorde; Salsa und Latin Jazz; Comping; {\"U}ben; H{\"o}ren; eine ausf{\"u}hrliche Diskographie.

Paradoxically, the free-energy profile along this coordinate may lack a refolding barrier, yet a barrier is known to exist for folding; thus, it has been argued that pulling experiments do not probe folding. Here, we show that transitions monitored in pulling experiments probe the true folding barrier but that the barrier may be hidden in the projection onto the pulling coordinate. However, one-dimensional theory using the pulling coordinate still yields physically meaningful energy landscape parameters.},

abstract = {Recently, the role of force in cellular processes has become more evident, and now with advances in force spectroscopy, the response of proteins to force can be directly studied. Such studies have found that native proteins are brittle, and thus not very deformable. Here, we examine the mechanical properties of a class of intermediates referred to as the molten globule state. Using optical trap force spectroscopy, we investigated the response to force of the native and molten globule states of apomyoglobin along different pulling axes. Unlike natively folded proteins, the molten globule state of apomyoglobin is compliant (large distance to the transition state); this large compliance means that the molten globule is more deformable and the unfolding rate is more sensitive to force (the application of force or tension will have a more dramatic effect on the unfolding rate). Our studies suggest that these are general properties of molten globules and could have important implications for mechanical processes in the cell.},

abstract = {Map makers have for many years searched for a way to construct cartograms, maps in which the sizes of geographic regions such as countries or provinces appear in proportion to their population or some other analogous property. Such maps are invaluable for the representation of census results, election returns, disease incidence, and many other kinds of human data. Unfortunately, to scale regions and still have them fit together, one is normally forced to distort the regions' shapes, potentially resulting in maps that are difficult to read. Many methods for making cartograms have been proposed, some of them are extremely complex, but all suffer either from this lack of readability or from other pathologies, like overlapping regions or strong dependence on the choice of coordinate axes. Here, we present a technique based on ideas borrowed from elementary physics that suffers none of these drawbacks. Our method is conceptually simple and produces useful, elegant, and easily readable maps. We illustrate the method with applications to the results of the 2000 U.S. presidential election, lung cancer cases in the State of New York, and the geographical distribution of stories appearing in the news.},
